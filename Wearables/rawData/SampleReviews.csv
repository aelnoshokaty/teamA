My nephew loves h8s new apple watch. The fact that its waterproof is a plus. Finding this on a black Friday deal was by far one of my best buys.
"The Apple Watch Series 6 has so many amazing features, but I think that the many different health readings it provides is what got my attention."
Replaced my Apple Watch with this gem. I like the durability and the battery life is OUT OF THIS WORLD. I took mine on a 5 day hunt. Using the \
My old Apple Watch stopped charging and I was bummed to have to buy another one but so glad that I did. This watch is much faster and more clear
I’m super pleased with these chargers. They work great with my Fitbit Versa 2. For the price of the two chargers I highly recommend buying them.
Excellent cover for the Apple Watch SE. I used the space gray and it serves great. It leaves enough access that you can switch the bands easily.
My wife's last apple watch lasted four years! This new one has been great so far! Hoping that we'll get at least the four years out of this one!
I gave this apple watch band and to my husband as he wanted something more “airy” to wear when working outside in the garden. He likes it a lot.
I love this watch!!!! Everyday I learn something new. I really wanted an Apple Watch but this one does everything I needed for a lot less money!
This item is perfect! Could not imagine spending more for a true Apple Watch. I love love love it. Big game changer in taking notes with my ipad
"Bought this for my relative as it’s their first Apple Watch series 6, they love it and enjoying and learning all its features bought him a 40 mm"
I needed a sport band and bought a cheaper band and it fell off and I broke my watch! Well I bought a new Apple Watch and a trusted watch brand!
Garmin -Forerunner 45 GPS heart Rate Monitor Running Smartwatch- Black is excellent watch. It is very convenient to have heath & Wellness watch.
Fitbit Versa 3 is a great affordable smartwatch. Watch is able to do most everything you ask in a smartwatch. It is an attractive watch as well.
Love my Apple Watch very stylish and very important for me with my exercises can’t make sure I’m getting the heart rate up and burning calories!
"Loved the price compared to the other Apple Watches.\n\nEven though it was a previous Generation, still has the same functions in an Apple Watch"
"The Fitbit Versa 2 does everything I wanted it to do and more. It has a large display, plus many other menu options. It also has a color screen."
"AJ was the best salesman ever ! Patient, friendly and knowledgeable! Found exactly what I wanted . Love my new Apple Watch!\nThank you Best Buy!"
I love this watch band. It's easy to wear and Velco closure stays tightly closed. I bought it for my Apple Watch Series 7 and it fits perfectly.
Charges my Apple Watch to full capacity without any issues and a longer cord than a regular Apple charger so it gives a bit more length. Love it
I love the color! I upgraded from a first addition Apple Watch. Now I can wear this one for almost a day and a half and not need to recharge it.
I have a Nike Apple Watch series 6 and wanted to have a watch band to match! The band fits perfectly and with a Nike face it really looks sharp!
"These apple watch bands are so comfortable. I've ordered miscellaneous, non apple, watch bands from other venders, but keep going back to these."
"I currently own a Fitbit Charge 2. I recently purchased the Charge 4. However, I returned the Charge 4 because it was very uncomfortable to wear."
Used it once before it broke. Never kept track of my sleep right didn't even work for keeping track of my runs. Get an apple watch - this is junk
It won’t charge my new I phone 13 pro it does charge my new Apple Watch series seven Nike edition but won’t work with the phone very disappointed
The charger that came with the Apple Watch doesn’t work fit in the rubber sleeve and will not charge. Completely defeats the purpose of purchase.
I love my Fitbit charge 4. But now the band connection broke off. I glued the plastic piece on and then taped it together with electricians tape.
"It's not like a apple watch ...but hey its android , it's a pretty fair purchase, this product needs work, I dont recommend buying this honestly."
Received an Apple Watch Charger instead. Not really worth my time to return so I bought another and hope the right one comes. Kind of a bummer :(
The Raptic-Edge Bumper may protect may Apple watch but it also keeps it from functioning optimally. I have difficulty accessing some of the apps.
"Nice band it did not fit the Apple Watch series 6 the way it should have. It did not stay locked into the watch, it was very loose. I returned it"
I really like the bumper for my apple watch is has protected my watch from being scratch or bumped while at work. It fits perfectly over my watch
The second best Apple Watch you can get that\u2019s behind the six it almost comes with the same stuff as the six but it\u2019s alittle different
This Apple Watch is by far the best on the market. I have tried many others that cant Mach this by any stretch. Great life mate! Quality products
It was very hard to connect the fitbit Charge 4 to my samsung phone even though it was on the list of phones that are compatible. It took 6 days.
"This is my second Apple Watch, my first one the screen faded out so bad that I couldn\u2019t see it anymore hoping for better luck with this one."
I ended up returning it because I couldn't connect AirPods to it. Other than that all the features worked great. Went with an Apple watch instead
Fits nice on the fitbit charge 3. but after a month or so the corners start to lift. you can reseal them but eventually they start lifting again.
I had no idea that an Apple Watch was so convenient to have in the house. I do not have to worry about bringing along my phone from room to room.
I love this smart watch from the display to the features but I would of loved if the battery lasted a bit longer coming from a Fitbit versa lite.
I love it ! Very accurate! Not sure you can shower with it. I personally don't. But who needs an Apple Watch when you got this ! Highly recommend
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I have been a Apple fan for 10 years. iPhones, iPads Apple Watch Apple Air Pods. Will be a fan forever"
Really really good...just as good as an apple watch....we have both and works just as well....havent had an issue yet....not one...its a must....
"I had the fitbit charge 2, but now I advanced to the Charge 4. I am using it in place of my Apple 6 until it arrives. it's doing the trick for me"
I LOVE my Apple Watch! I cant imagine living without it. Does so much and everyday Im finding more things it does. Definitely an awesome wearable
I have owned an Apple Watch before. I enjoyed in but it was a series one. I like the new features and this one seems to be a lot more responsive.
"My Apple Watch works in the greatest way. I\u2019m happy that I have this now , so when I don\u2019t want to use my phone , I just use my watch ."
The band is easy to attach & secure to the wrist \nWears very well & comfortable It was easy to attach to my Apple Watch & can easily be fastened
Next gen Apple Watch. Upgrades like the ecg are nice to have. Not sure how accurate it is but seems to be good. Nicely built and worth the price.
Not bad at all works perfectly fine for me. \nIt’s not the newest but I like it. Save some money \nEasy setup it’s my first Apple Watch I love it
Bought as a gift for wife’s birthday. Has more features that the Apple Watch at this price range with about the same battery life. Wife loves it.
I love my Apple Watch. I was in between with SE and 6 but definitely went with this one as did not want to pay $150 more to see my oxygen level:)
"Love my Apple Watch! I use it to track my miles when I walk . Adjusting the face to my liking , changing wristbands, etc are all very easy to do."
"I loved my Apple Watch. Quick, easy order process and they sell at the same price as Apple. The Apple Watch is easy to use and keeps me motivated"
"Excellent gift! Love it.\nEasy to use, paired it with my phone and now can use my Fitbit Versa 2, read news, track my exercise routine, diet etc."
"Watch band that came with the Apple Watch is not easy to put on. The metal watch band is a must, much easier to put the watch on and take it off."
"My first Apple watch. It's really a cool device. The 38 mm size was the perfect size, I'm not sure they make it that small in the newer releases."
I’m in love with this watch band it’s a better pink then my Apple Watch comes with its brighter and it gets less dirty compared to the other band
Amazing value. Does everything my wife\u2019s Apple Watch 5 does. I\u2019m very pleased. I love my Apple Watch and no better prices than Best Buy
"I love that you can buy Apple Watch bands at Best Buy for half the price the Apple sells them for, and the quality, I doubt there's a difference."
I purchased this for my wife and she loves it. She says the band is very comfortable and she likes the screen size compared to her Fitbit Charge.
"Apple Watch are great and this one I bought for my wife and she loves it. Works great for all it is suppose to do. Also, the battery life is good"
This is my second Apple Watch and I still love the product. The Apple Waych is pretty much a part. Of me and I barely go anywhere without it now!
Ordered online and it was ready within an hour. An associate brought it right to my car. Love the Apple Watch it helps me keep up with my fitness
I was between the apple watch or airpods and I think I get way more from the airpods. Theyre perfect!!! and so many cute cases you can buy for it
I am so happy I waited to purchase this watch! I got the very first Apple Watch some years ago and I must say this generation is way more better!
Excellent product very well made .. use to have this type of band when I had a series 3 Apple Watch .. easy to clean as well with soap and water.
Love this Apple Watch Band! Adjusting the band is so easy! So light & much cooler for the summer months! Bought mine when open box was available!
I couldn\u2019t live without my Apple watch! Best accessory I\u2019ve ever bought! System still runs well and always stays connected to my phone.
I purchased this as a gift . It was very timely because the person who received it was able to check their EKG with the Apple Watch. A life saver
"I have had many smart watches but this is my first Apple Watch and I love it, is fantastic, the quality is huge, is beautiful and very funcional."
I really love my Fitbit Inspire HR.. Has me up and moving and making great progress in helping me lose weight..It does so much at a great price..
Finally talked her into Apple Watch as she had a Fitbit. She loves the watch as it has so many more features than the Fitbit and is more durable.
I can use it with my Apple Watch which means I don’t have to take my phone on walks. I can let people in my house from any where - so convenient.
"I\u2019ve had 2 Fitbits and while I\u2019ve been happy with them, the Apple Watch is in a league of its own. Stylish, comfortable, and versatile."
"While I love my apple watch I feel the size is a bit too much. Looking back at it, I would get the smaller size and save the difference in price."
I love this smart watch. It looks very simple but it almost has all the feature you can find in fit-bit and apple watch. Totally worth the price.
"Arrived on time , in perfect condition. My 1\u2019st Apple Watch. Recommend watching some you tube video\u2019s to get comfortable setting it up."
Easy to use and pair with my apple phone Fraction of the price compared to an apple watch. Not really into named brands if it serves its purpose.
Band came earlier than I thought. Color was exactly as depicted in photo. Looks great with my silver apple watch. Would defiantly buy from again!
"This was a Christmas present for my son, he has enjoyed the use of his Nike Apple Watch. He wears it daily and he has not had any issues to dare."
Got an apple watch and needed an extra charger - this one works perfectly. Definitely recommend if you need an extra and want to save some money.
Apple Watch Series 3 gps/cellular...Watch in excellent condition. Took a while to update but I just let it update over night. Speaker is amazing.
Love this thing! It's like an Apple watch but so much less money and l with just as cool features! Makes an excellent fitness tracker in the gym!
"Amazing apple watch, I have been using this for less than two weeks and it is very good. This device was an upgrade from my Apple Watch Series 3."
Upgraded from an Apple Watch Series 2. Love it. I see no difference with functionality though I’ve not really explored what’s different about it.
I love my new Apple Watch better than the first six watches. I love service I received from Best Buy and for having the watch I were looking for.
Very prestigious Apple Watch! This is actually the one I would recommend if you are not a strenuous adventurer and it is useful in all occasions!
"Very nice, graphics on the 45 Apple Watch 7 is great, very clear and sharp picture, of course appreciate the Apple products, including the ipads…"
Love the fast delivery and love my new Apple Watch. I use it for fitness and it\u2019s especially handy for reading texts while I\u2019m working.
I got Apple Watch 38mm black for my wife on her birthday and she wanted to put rose gold belt \nBy buying this it looked good with rose gold belt
I replaced an existing rubber band that came with my Apple Watch. This one doesn't cause my wrist to break out and keeps my watch nice and tight.
using this for my new apple watch. Easy to put on and comfortable to wear. I prefer this over the plastic one that comes standard with the watch.
Perfect stand for the Apple Watch in nightstand mode. Magnet links watch to charger with ease. NOTE: does not come with additional watch charger.
I went to Best Buy to see about getting my series 3 Apple Watch repaired and they talked me into not only replacing but upgrading. I'm glad I did
"This is our 2nd apple watch, and I have to say that the quality of this model is on point. The OS is very friendly and overall it is a great buy."
"I like all the apps and features of the Apple Watch. I have used it for texting, emails, exercise, time, date, weather, and talking on the phone."
"Gotta tell you, I\u2019ve got tons of watch bands for my Apple Watch and this is definitely one of my favorites! Have not noticed any wear on it."
Got my Fitbit Versa 2 this morning. I've been playing around with it all morning. Loving all the new features! Having Alexa on my wrist is great!
Apple Watch Nike Series 5 (GPS + Cellular) 44mm Space Gray Aluminum Case with Anthracite/Black Nike Sport Band - Space Gray Aluminum is excellent
This Christmas I will have had my Apple Watch 4 for two years. It has performed perfectly. I plan to trade up this Christmas. I highly recommend.
I love my apple watch series 3 (gps). I enjoy having it and being able to talk through the speaker microphone to send responses to text messages.
I've tried several different types and brands of smartwatches the Galaxy Active 2 is by far the best even compared to my daughters apple watch!!!
I waited a long time and finally purchased an Apple Watch. It is one of my best purchases ever. It’s features are unending. I absolutely love it!
The best tech experience ever if you’re someone that has an active lifestyle and would appreciate conveniency here it is the apple watch series 5
All my teenage daughter has wanted for Christmas is an Apple watch. This version fits what she needs and is a great value vs. the newer versions!
Bought this for my wife as an early Christmas gift and she loves it. The features are very similar to my Apple Watch 7 and it’s half the price!!!
My watch band purchased from Best Buy is awesome. The band is strong and looks attractive on my Apple Watch. I\u2019m getting lots of Complements
I have used this Apple Watch everyday (without exception) for nearly six months now. It works so well and everything about it is super intuitive.
"I can’t believe I went this long without an Apple Watch, can’t leave the house without it and makes work life easy when you work with your hands!"
Apple watches are the way to go. I do love my samsung but the simplicity of the apple watch is amazing. It makes it simple to use and understand.
This is by far my favorite Apple Watch band!! The staff was very friendly and helpful!! I will definitely be back when I need another watch band!
"Replaced another Apple Watch Series 3 that had its screen crack. Really glad they are still making this affordable, but still really good option!"
"I really like this apple watch 6,I traded in my apple waatch 3 for it\nall the new features i wanted especially the heart apps and the blue color"
I had to return this item because my children gave my wife an Apple watch for her birthday. It performed very well for the sort time she used it.
The Insigna Magnetic charging cable for the Apple watch works perfectly. Plug it into the USB port in a vehicle or at home and the watch charges.
"The band is very pretty, easy to put on, and fits my Apple Watch perfectly! It was shipped quickly and packaged well. I’m happy with my purchase."
Absolutely love this Gold Apple Watch! It looks stunning with the blue strap and bought the accessory gold magnetic mesh band also for dresswear!
"I bought these to adapt my Apple Watch charging cable to connect it with a traditional USB cable so we can use our wall charger. Works perfectly,"
I love my Apple Watch! I recently had a heart issue and I love that I can check my EKG and heart rate! All the other features are wonderful also!
Fitbit Versa 2 has stopped working. Item was purchased 6/13/2021. Will not hold a charge. Would like a replacement. How can this be accomplished ?
Do not buy . The Apple Watch app on iPhones is crashing a lot recently and renders Apple Watch useless ! Safe the $500 and buy a good Garmin watch
The pin to attach the band to the Fitbit Versa was broken and the strap was to fat to fit in the Fitbit Versa slot that you insert the band in to.
I had to return them was the wrong size for my Apple Watch . But I purchased some other ones . I love to shop at Best Buy online or in the store .
What a great and much more affordable alternative to the Apple Watch. The style is simple and sleek and does everything I need. Good for the price
this is a good experience to have an apple watch. But it is not much useful. Apple watch sensors are possibly better than other available watches.
It protects the apple watch 360 (body and screen) I removed a star because it can get dirty really quick but it can be resolved with a quick wash.
Great alternative to Apple brand. I have the insignia phone cables so I tried this and it works just like the Apple Watch charger at a good price.
I really like how it works with my apple watch and phone. very easy to connect and use music for sleep time or playing with doing things close by.
Upgraded from a series 5 you cant hardly spot the differences. but the watch is nice and if youve never owned an apple watch i highly recommend it
This is the third apple watch I owned - it replace one that I broke - its a good value given the price without paying for features that i dont use
Great quality video and easy setup. Provides great peace of mind when I am away by sending motion alerts with a photo to my phone and Apple Watch.
Great watch. Love that you can turn on water mode and wear it while swimming. Wish it had a longer battery life. But comparable to an Apple Watch.
Bought this product so I could charge the new Apple Watch since it didn’t come with one in the box. It works as designed and the price was decent.
Love my Apple Watch! The health features really help me track my fitness goals better than I’d ever expected. Couldnt be happier with my purchase.
"It is my 4th Fitbit, (Charge 2, Versa, Versa2, and Sense), I love all of them. I don't like that they changed the bands from versa 2 to Sense tho."
Got it for my wife as she’s been wanting a blue replacement band for her Apple Watch 4. Had it for a while now and still in great shape. Good buy.
Love my Apple Watch being able to connect to my phone and also being able to make and receive calls and messages without having to pickup my phone
"I was skeptical about upgrading from my Apple Watch Series 1 to this, but I am so glad I did. The watch has a lot of great specs to it. I love it!"
"I love this Fitbit. It has just enough features to be worth the extra money. I bought it because the Apple Watch was too expensive, and I love it."
Got the watch for my fiancé. She absolutely loves it. It\u2019s Apple Fitness + compatible. Very easy to use. Was really cheap for a Apple Watch .
"This is my sixth Apple Watch, and continuously rotate between three of them (I gave my old ones to my sons). The finish on this case is beautiful."
The Apple Watch works very good with the Apple phone makes your life a lot easier without having to pick up your phone every morning or every text
"My husband doesn’t like to wear anything on his wrist, so when I got him the new Fitbit inspire, I also purchase these. Fit well and he was happy."
"This protect great and gives you a piece of mind of having to worry about damaging you Apple Watch. It is pricey, but so far it has held up great."
Apple Watch. Does everything you expect it to. It’s comfortable and easy to set up. Very pleased with the battery life of this watch. Looks great.
"Apple Watch is a do it all tool. My wife loves it. She tracks workouts, heart rate, and sleep habits. It also is a great y tool for communication."
I\u2019ve used a few smart watches before and the Apple Watch just stays out of the way. It\u2019s the best example for a future of smart watches.
Works as expected. Keeps Apple watch fully charged. Easy to set up. Display dimming feature is nice. Keeps bedroom from being too bright at night.
"Great value! The band fit my new Apple watch I6 well. The downfall would be that it builds heat up, and by the end of the day, it had to come off!"
The best Apple Watch band ever. Fits right. Looks gorgeous. Goes well with both formal and casual look. Very comfortable to wear. Quality product.
"Upgraded from Charge 2. More options, as well as GPS, which was a key 'sell' for this versus Apple watch. So far, pleased with this tracker/watch."
Great apple watch. Works great and allows me to track my walking and activity. It was a great purchase and highly recommend for tracking activity.
I love my Apple Watch Series 5! I was worried at first that I was spending so much money on something but the value of this watch is immeasurable!
My husband is happy with the watch. It does what was advertised. He doesn’t need all apps that come on Apple watch and this is a good alternative.
It’s a little tough to get the phone on the charger connection but it works great and I love that you can throw the Apple Watch on to charge also.
This is the second Apple Watch cover we have purchased and they are great. Not only is the face covered but it does not impede the touch features.
"I switched from a Fitbit versa. Although I loved my Fitbit, the Apple Watch does so much more. I will probably never go back to a different brand."
I needed a USB C charger for my Apple Watch when traveling. This one works great and has a short cord so I am not tripping over the charging cord.
Just received my Apple Watch and I’m already in love with it.So easy to use and user friendly.I would definitely recommend this to everyone I know
What a wonderful watch ! I really like the idea. I have an Apple Watch but I’ve been using this watch to run and the app come with is really good.
I got this watch for my daughter!! It wasn’t as expensive as the Apple Watch and pretty much do all the same things!!! We are loving this watch!!!
great smart watch that puts Apple watch to shame... it makes the apple watch look like Fisher Price's My First Smart Watch so listen up millennial
"My original Fitbit versa finally stopped working, so I bought the versa 2 and just love it. No complaints, tracks and syncs better than the first!"
The Fitbit Inspire is much easier for me to wear than the bracelet style trackers. It\u2019s great for counting my steps and keeping me motivated!
Doesn't have the bells and whistles as an apple watch does but is a far better value and very effective. Listening to music on the watch is a pain
The Series 5 Apple Watch is awesome and the amount of bands that are available at Amazon for it is amazing as I can have a new watch look daily!!!
"I bought the Fossil for the style of the watch. I am not to satisfied with it, the battery doesn’t last. I think I’m going back to my Apple Watch."
Love the Apple Watch. Accidentally put in the washer and still works after getting soaked. Convenient to check texts and email among other things.
"I had the Apple Watch series 3 and decided to upgrade to the series 5. Overall it is a great upgrade, and the battery life in my opinion is great."
"I bought this for my daughter to replace her Apple Watch 3. It\u2019s much faster, works great on her runs and does what she needs. She loving it."
Neat watch for the price. Battery life is excellent! Does almost everything an Apple Watch does minus the text back feature. Overall great product
I own another Fitbit. This is the second one for my family and I really like the sleep analysis which Apple Watch still does not have to this day.
"I use it more than my Apple Watch 4. I like using Samsung Pay, since I can use at more places. Nice watch faces & ease of use are attractive also."
Great Apple Watch and I love the always on display. Nice to glance at my watch without having to raise my wrist. The battery lasts me all day too.
Works great out of the box. I like this series 5 better then the very first Apple Watch. The bigger 44 millimeter face is much more user friendly.
"It looks and works awesome!! This one was an upgraded from an old Mac and I am in love with all the new features, like unlock with my Apple Watch:"
The Apple Watch has exceeded my expectations. I got it for Fitness+ but all the other amazing things I found that it does has really surprised me.
I bought this to replace the non-Apple watch. It's great for tracking steps and heart rate. It also beeps whenever someone is at my Ring doorbell.
I've been using it for about 3 days on a single charge. It's much better battery life than my old Apple Watch which is the main reason I switched.
Order came earlier than scheduled and I love my watch and AirPods. Would definitely order again ! Also bought an Apple Watch that is great as well
I enjoy the watch and wear it daily. It is really addicting trying to close all of your rings!! Great value for an earlier generation Apple Watch.
I get compliments every time I wear it. Dresses up my Apple Watch for a professional atmosphere. People are shocked when I tell them of low price.
After 6 months my wrist started breaking out in a rash wearing the original Apple Watch band. This band is comfortable and I have had no reaction.
"Love it, replace of my Apple watch 2 and it is so much faster, battery life seems to be similar tho. I think the workout counting is more accurate"
"I really took my time in buying an Apple Watch but I am so glad I did! I love this watch so much, it was easy to set up and now I use it everyday."
"I purchased this, as the original band for the Fitbit Versa was falling apart. This is a wonderful replacement at a reasonable price. Recommended!"
"I don't know how I lived without an Apple Watch all my life. Really great for jumpstarting a new, healthy lifestyle. Don't regret this buy at all!"
"I love my Apple Watch! It tracks my steps, exercises, and how long I’ve been standing. It’s even waterproof. I swim with it on! No problem at all!"
"Can’t leave the house without it, from gps to phone calls and cycle monitoring… my apple watch does it all. The service at Best Buy was excellent."
Love my new Apple Watch but there times I which I had gotten the cellular version. Definitely consider that aspect when deciding on getting ozone.
Didn’t like the Apple Watch as it needs to charge so often! So happy with my Fitbit as I ca wear it a lot more and it doesn’t take long to charge!
"This has saved our daughters Apple Watch on a few occasions, especially when she forgot to take it off before catching lessons or a softball game."
I love my Apple Watch! It\u2019s convenient because I don\u2019t have to pull my phone out of my purse. All my messages come straight to my phone.
I love my Apple Watch! There’s not a day that I don’t wear it. It comes in handy so much for when I get a text or need to change my music and etc!
Upgraded from an Apple Watch series 3 and it was a great choice. It is so fast compared to the series 3 and that bigger display is a game changer!
"I cannot believe how nice this is, especially for the price. It even came with an extra little bar. Fits my Fitbit Versa nicely. Highly recommend!"
Fits perfectly with my Apple Watch. This band is super sleek and goes well with any color of the apple watches. It is comfortable to wear all day.
"Purchased an Apple Watch for my wife’s birthday, she absolutely loved it. Watch works great, battery life could be better, but not a deal breaker."
I love my Apple Watch!\nIt is super practical device with “mind” built into it! Wearing every day.\nWill never go back to Android operating watch.
We upgraded from the Apple Watch 3 and new health-monitoring features. We loved our Apple 3 watches and this SE has everything the 3 has and more.
"This replaced a Fitbit watch, wish I’d done it sooner. Apple Watch has more options and works seamlessly with all my other devices. Great product!"
"You can not go wrong with an Apple watch. Voice texting, phone calls, camera remote, fitness tracker, etc... A very nice, well thought out device."
"I love my watch, it tracks everything i want it to, i can play my music from it and lots of other things. Upgraded from the 1st Samsung gear fit!!"
I picked this up for my daughter for her birthday. She had never worn a watch but now she sleeps with the Apple Watch had is able track her sleep.
Great wireless charging pad for those with multiple devices. Wont work for your Apple watch or airpods unfortunately :( at least it didnt for mine
"I love the product so much I\u2019ve never had any problem with the charge series. They always last me a long time, fitbit over Apple Watch anyday"
Love love love my new Apple Watch is great. I upgraded from the series 3 to the new series 6. Love the hand wash feature and the new heart oxygen.
Love the operation and fit of this watch. It was to replace an older Apple Watch and I'm very pleased. I really like the larger face of the watch.
I thought I could get on by without using an Apple Watch until I finally got one. The convenience this brings to my life was well worth the price.
The Apple Watch Stand-Tranesca is a functional charger with nice design. I bought 3 now for various rooms. It is priced well too. Would recommend.
"Great buy! My first Apple Watch, and it is very convenient. I bought it to help me get my fitness back on track but it has a ton of cool features."
I needed a spare charger for my Apple Watch. This one works great and charges much faster than the one I originally had. I still use it regularly.
This is my 2nd Garmin Instinct. New features & capabilities added. Takes a while to learn them all but easy to start with the basics. Great watch!
Wife Loves it. This is her 2nd one. She uses this for her workouts and loves it. She had the Apple Watch but likes the display on this one better.
"Got this for my wife for her Apple Watch. Has a nice, soft touch material and allows her Apple Watch band to breathe more due to the perforations."
"Third Apple Watch; great price, holds a charge for 48 hours, great for tracking fitness, checking texts and email…and plenty more a teacher needs!"
Got it so I could use my Apple Watch Series 7 charging cable with my USB-A charger. No problems so far with daily use. Built quality is very good.
"I love the Apple Watch 7. I replaced Fitbit with it, I find it easier to use than my Fitbit, easier keeping track of my heart rate while spinning."
The first Fitbit Inspire I ordered stopped working after a couple of weeks. The second one I received lasted about four months and no longer works.
Had lots of air bubbles and felt very cheap. Definitely not worth the $15 I spent on it. Removed it from my apple watch immediately after applying.
"I have a series 7 Apple Watch, it took 6hrs just to get me too 30% I’m returning it back I would never be able to charge my watch with this device."
Horrible. I purchased this specifically to charge my apple watch but it doesnt work. Charges phone ok but not worth the price. Highly disappointed.
Exactly one year after getting Fitbit Charge 4 it has quit working. Called Fitbit help line and had no success getting it to work even after reset.
Best buy not only took the amount of my Apple Watch out of my account but also held that amount for seven days. I will never do business with them.
I am a little disappointed with it. The edge of it has peeled up and now has dirt under it. It does not stick well on the edges of the Apple Watch.
My son likes this watch very much. Looks like an Apple Watch but much cheaper. Only thing is it makes his arm itch a little. Would still recommend!
"It works. If you have a fossil gen 4 or 5 smart watch, you will need if if, like me, you find your current cable decides to up and kick the bucket."
Amongst all the series so far from Apple Watch- I suggest it is economically cheap and provides all most of the features same as the latest series.
Great fit for the Apple Watch. I do have a spot that lifted from catching on some thing and it shows. Can\u2019t fix it but otherwise item is great
"That band looks great. It looks great with the apple watch. It is a little stiff at first, but it breaks in well. Overall very happy with the band."
"Love the Garmin Venu, my husband both got these in different color ways. Product is amazing, price tag is steep, but you do get what you pay for ;)"
So far really happy with the Apple Watch as good as advertised love the cellular for when I’m walking nice to have music without carrying my phone!
I love my new apple watch it does a lot more than fit bits. It's a little bit more but worth the price. You will totally enjoy all of the features.
The Apple watch Catalyst protective band is as advertised and is of top quality . Great product one of the best sales to protect you’re Apple Watch
Better than the standard solid band that comes with the Apple Watch. This breathes better of course and is more comfortable because it flexes more.
I lost my original band to my Fitbit charge 3. It was on the small side for me. These band are great. I wear them everyday. I have had no problems.
"Apple watch’s are very useful specially when you have to multitask at work, you do not to physically pull your phone out to text back or call back."
"Love my Apple Watch and how it keeps me motivated to stay fit, reminds me to take a moment to breathe and monitors my heart health. It\u2019s dope!"
Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS) 38mm Silver Aluminum Case with White Sport Band - Silver Aluminum. Bought this for my daughter - she is in love with it.
I could not do without this item in my bathroom. Love the nightlight and that I’m able to plug in two items while charging my phone and Apple Watch
I love apple watch. Fits perfect. Love all the features it has. Great price. Exactly a good fit for me. Im not tech savy and this is user friendly.
Compared to the Fitbit it may not have as many perks and whatnot but give it time and you will see the Amazon Halo will become quite the contender!
I had a fitbit versa 2 before getting this. This watch offers so much more and overall I love it. Really glad I switched when I decided to upgrade.
"It looks sharp - simple clean design. Easy to put on. It fits the 38mm Apple watch perfectly, and also fits my wife's wrist. The color is gorgeous!"
A gift fir my wife and she loves it. Thought she would say \u201cBut I wanted an Apple Watch \u201c but that did not happen. It is light and sleek.
Hello Best Buy I love my Apple Watch series 3 38mm watch it keep me busy with my workout. Reminder and i love so much I\u2019m happy that I got it.
Excellent watch in android though it won't beat the Apple Watch. If you are using Android phone this is the best watch so far for low price option.
Love this watch. Gave it as a gift and the recipient loves it. Hard for her to take it off. It\u2019s a great entry level/first Apple Watch to own.
I love this watch! Samsung does it again. You can't go wrong between this and an apple watch. Everything you can want and all for in a smart watch.

"I’ve wanted an Apple Watch since they were invented lol, I’m in love with this one. Perfect for me and I’m so happy with it, no complaints at all!!"
I have had an Apple Watch before so I am slightly partial. I use it every day for work at an animal hospital and it is always there when I need it.
Very happy with the bigger screen and the newer feature the Apple Watch 6 offers. The battery life is great and is everything he could have wanted.
I have had my Fitbit charge 2 for a few years now and this is the best band by far that I have gotten for it. I love the way it fits and the style!

This cake highly recommended by my friends when choosing between an Apple Watch and a fit bit! I love the sleekness and how it syncs with my phone.
Always stay connected with Apple Watch. No more expensive luxury watches that does nothing but tell time. Do yourself a favor. Buy an Apple Watch .
I wonder what I did before Ring. So nice to know when the kids go in and out. My Apple Watch shows me the notifications. I feel safer and informed.
"First apple watch, glad I got it from Best buy, as it had a bigger sale on it than apple at the time. Works great, no issues, definitely recommend!"
I love it. I initially wanted to get myself an Apple Watch but later realized this fit bit does all I needed from the Apple Watch. Saved me some $$
This is the only band that I have purchased for my Apple Watch that has actually lasted as long as I've had the watch. Its pretty good looking too.
"Love the apple watch, wear and use it everyday. Has helped during exercising and quick texts. This watch has a lot of other great and useful specs."
I previously had the Fitbit ionic but it stopped charging after the warranty expired. I changed it up to the garmin and I’m really liking it so far
"It\u2019s a great Apple Watch, but it looks like there no longer offering the Apple Watch 4 per apple.com which is strange. It functions very well."
"I love my new Fitbit 5. It is so much easier to use than my previous Fitbit Charge 4, especially the clock feature. I’m also enjoying the new band."
"Paired easily with my samsung, works great looks cute. i only wish they made the bumper like they do for apple watch so i can protect my investment"
"Since having to buy the usb-c adapter for my apple watch it was very easy to stop buy BB on the way home, since it wasn't included with my new AW7."
This is a great Apple Watch with the latest technology. The ease of use and the data the watch produces is fabulous. I highly recommend this watch.
Really like the bigger screen to the Apple Watch & the really good battery ! I’ve had apple watches before but this is definitely the best one yet.
"I think the Apple Watch is amazing because I can change the screen display at any time. Also, it shows me how many steps I walked and my heartbeat."
This is the third Apple Watch that I purchased. This is a very good price for Christmas gifts. I wouldn\u2019t purchase anything but a Apple Watch.
Looks just like an Apple Watch! My husband loves it! He never wanted to get something too expensive because of his job and this is perfect for him!
I\u2019ve been wanting a watch for awhile. I was contemplating on getting the Apple Watch but I love the purchase. It\u2019s sleek and easy to use.
I love this band. Purchased for my Apple Watch. It is high quality and well made. The color doesn\u2019t fade. This band is good nut for the price.
Love my watch. This is an Apple product that has lasted and I can’t imagine not having an Apple Watch now. Will be buying another when this breaks.
"Works well to compliment my Apple Watch charger. However, it would’ve been better if the Series 6 Apple Watch came with a power adapter of its own."
This Apple Watch is everything I expected. I bought this watch to record my steps and other activities and it doing a great job. I love this watch.
Super amazing! Been wanting to track my workouts and long walks without spending so much on an Apple Watch. Affordable and reliable. Great purchase
I bought this for my mother who doesn\u2019t need a fancy Apple Watch. She was just looking for something to keep track of her steps. Great product
This band is very comfortable and the ventilation holes make it great for use during exercise. I’d highly recommend this band for your Apple Watch.
I bought this for my son's 23 birthday. He loves it. I didn't want to get the apple Nike watch. So I bought the band & apple watch. Would buy agsin

I've wanted an apple watch for a long time. I got this as a Christmas gift. I love it. The only negative thing would be I have to charge it nightly
If you want to protect that expensive apple watch your better get this. Works very good and you can see the watch face clearly when it is in place.
Good basic Apple Watch (series 3). Didn\u2019t need extra functionality of the Series 7 so this had a great price point and on sale $20 below that.
Upgraded from the original Apple Watch. Definitely see the difference. I’m loving the fast charge in 1hr it goes from near death to fully charged!!
I had purchased an Apple Watch Series 7 for myself and loved it so much that I bought one for my 86 year old Dad for his birthday! He is loving it.
Love my apple watch as it helps push me with my workouts and helpful to keep up with alerts as I don't always have my phone sitting out on my desk.
Best face protector for the Apple Watch. I have tried others that I continually have to replace. You don\u2019t even know I have a protector on it.
Needed a new band for my Asus zenwatch 2. 22mm band fits well. It did say it was for a Apple watch but when you get it you take off the end pieces.
I love the FitBit Versa. Battery life is great and it can last days without charging. it has more tracking features such as sleep tracking and etc.
I upgraded from a fitbit charge to the 4. So far so good. Still trying get use to additional features. All in all i am very happy with the purchase
Wanted an Apple Watch for a while but was hesitant I wouldn’t like the bulk on my small wrists- this one fits great and I love all of the features!
Really good bumpers for the Apple Watch. Good price and decent quality to keep off the scratches and dings. Going to get another set for a present.
Apple watch series 6 44mm stainless steel very nice watch. I wanted just the watch since I already had 44mm stainless steel band to use with watch.
"I hand been purchasing Apple Watch since series one. I will continue to purchase as I love it for workouts, texting during busy shifts and sharing."
It’s my first apple watch and I’m loving it. I drive a lot and in need of navigation this notified me of turns and location so I don’t miss my way.

I’m loving my Apple Watch. At first I didn’t want it and I kept saying no it’s too expensive. Now having it you truly get what you pay for and more
Easy to install. Velcro strap hold on very well. I wear my Apple Watch to play basketball. And it hasn\u2019t come undone. Easy to remove and wash.
My wife is learns more about her Apple Watch everyday. It is not just a watch but monitors her exercise and connects her with her texts and phones.
"This has been a great little charger. Connected to my Anker MagSafe travel stand it can change my phone, iPods pro, and Apple Watch simultaneously."
"I decided to buy the Apple Watch after a health scare , with its heart rate monitor and it’s built in EKG monitor it keeps me on top of my health !"
I needed an adapter for the charger on my new Apple Watch so I could connect the cable to a older USB-A power charger block. This item did the job.
First Apple watch in the family. Love the sleek look and functionality is off the charts. I'm sure to get one for my spouse for a birthday present.
Love this apple watch and the sport black sports band. I really enjoy screening my cell phone calls as well as all the neat apps and face displays!
Have been wanting to get an Apple watch for some time and finally bit the bullet. This thing is amazing. Completely satisfied with this purchase!!!
"I received an Apple Watch which was ""renewed"" not in original packaging. Buyers beware of reconstructed/renewed electronics. This is a no-go for me."
sport band duo for apple watch... don't bother. It's definitely not worth the money. It's great for a couple of months then it starts falling apart.
This product has been worthless on my Apple watch. The glass cover will not stay on the watch and the rubber bumper just makes the issue even worse.
I have had several Timex Ironman watches over last 12 years that all worked very well. I have never had one completely die out of the box like this.
Returned this watch and bought a Garmin venu. I'm much happier. Fitbit want you to subscribe to a monthly reporting system. I didn't like that idea.
Having an Apple Watch with only gps was a waste of money. I returned this within a couple days. It didn\u2019t have a much of a reach on it as told.
It’s ok. It’s not all it’s hyped up to be. I was probably better off getting an Apple Watch. The batter definitely doesn’t last 6 days like it says.
Good product but I had some trouble applying the product for the first time to an Apple Watch. I had a couple small bubbles that would not come out.
Still learning it. I haven't had an apple watch since the first gen. I love the oxygen and heart rate features! Also definitely better battery life.
Quality silicone watchband for Apple Watch. Last OEM watchband broke after just one year. This one seems thicker. And has multiple adjustment holes.
It works well but I think you would get more for your buck if you got an Apple Watch. Got this for my mom and she wore it at first and know does not
So far so good! It\u2019s only been a month. I had a Best Buy associate install it on my Apple Watch 7 series and it has worked as described so far.
"I love my new fitbit charge 4, I'm so happy with it. It connects to my rewards program through my Insurance. I love that it has a GPS built into it."
"Everything is working fine, no issues whatsoever. Easy to use, from the app and from the Apple Watch!! I rarely use the actual restart viper button."
This watch does everything an Apple Watch does for a fraction of the money. The only thing missing was written instructions but I did figure it out.
Oh my goodness I am naked without my Apple Watch I have gone through every Jen and everyone gets better I can’t live without this device on my wrist
"It looks sharp - simple clean design. It fits the Fitbit Charge 2 watch perfectly, and also fits my wrist. It is very stylish, and I love the color."
Bought this Apple Watch for my daughter\u2019s birthday and she uses it everyday!! She has improved on her fitness goals thanks to the fitness apps!
I love my series 4 Apple watch! It seems even more user friendly than the 2 I had before. It always asks me if I need help if I fall or bang around!
This is the best smart watch that I have.i used Android watches but none of them compare to the apple watch.the always on display is amazing.love it
This device syncs perfectly with Wahoo Fitness on my phone and appears to have quality construction. Will update review after several months of use.
I have a small wrist and it fits perfectly! Love the carbon fiber look! Protects the watch pretty well! Looks nice and bulky on the 44mm apple watch
"This is a Nike/Apple Watch Sport Band. They are more breathable than the standard Apple Sport Band, so your wrist doesn't feel as sweaty during use."
First smart watch I have owned. I love this Apple watch. It does everything I need it to and I have been much more active with the activity program.
"Works great with Apple Watch. A little thicker than the Apple charger but is more stable on the night stand, seems to charge the watch just as fast."
An amazing protector for my Apple Watch! The band breathes perfectly to allow for ventilation. Also keeps my watch from getting scratched or dinged.
"I love my Apple Watch! I use it everyday to keep track of my steps, check my texts and use the Sleep Watch App each night to check my sleep quality."
Loving my new Fitbit Versa 2. I purchased the Versa as an upgrade from the Fitbit Charge 2 that stopped working after 6 months. Crossing my fingers.
I think no need to describe about apple watch because it is one of the best smartwatch in the market right now. Screen looks great and looks awsome.
I had been contemplating an Apple Watch for a while and with the reviews and updates decided on the S5. Process was simple and could not be happier!
It was so simple to use right out of the box. Makes me feel better to know my phone is getting properly cleaned. I even put my Apple Watch in there.
I’m a big Apple fan so of course I love the Apple Watch. The 40mm option fits my wrist nicely and I enjoy having the compass feature on this series.
I love my new Apple Watch. I had to order it and was disappointed in how long it took to get it but it was a good price and Best Buy did a good job.
This charger works well with the Apple watch and it charges really quick. It is also great when travelling it fits right in your purse or small bag.
"the band is so perfect it makes my apple watch feel\nso lightweight, it feels like I don’t even have it on and the velcro makes it easier to put on."
I have been very happy with the Fitbit Charge 3 as its a step up from the Charge 2. So glad I don't have to constantly take it off to take a shower.
"I prefer the Apple Watch Series 4 to the 5 for the battery life alone. We didn’t need an always on screen, and like the form factor of the Series 4."
He says now he has same watch as his mommy's apple watch! he is learning to tell time and taking pictures and all the other things this watch can do
"This is a nice upgrade to my Fitbit Versa; it has a few new features that I like, i.e. the option to have several face plate options to choose from."
Love the integration of wireless charging and Apple Watch charging capability. I wish there was a USB slot so I can potentially charge another item.
"I hesitated to buy an Apple Watch. But, I am glad I bought this one. The colors are great and the watch is easy to use. More durable than I thought."
Best in class the Apple watch series 5 has excellent features compared to others in the same market. I highly recommend this to anyone in the market
Love the way my apple watch works. It\u2019s very handy to recall information when you are in a hurry. Helps a lot when you need to find your phone.
I had to get the upgrade! New features are great smooth and sailing! Ever since I bought an Apple Watch I was hooked and stunned with process if it.
"Watch works great, a little tough to hook it all up but once its done its easy and very accurate. got a lot nicer look than the apple watch as well."
What\u2019s not to like with an Apple Watch! Love all the bells and whistles. Still learning all the different features with this watch. Very happy.
More helpful than expected. Apple watch 4 with battery no longer making it through the day. Keeping this charger handy can give it the boost needed.
Arguably one of the best purchases I e made in a long while! Food turns out perfect every time! And so easy to use with the phone or my Apple Watch.
"Bought this for my son as a gift. It was his first Apple Watch and he loves it. After a year, I was convinced to purchase my first Apple watch also."
I enjoyed my Fitbit but my lifestyle and exercise regimen has changed so that I need more feedback on performance- the Apple Watch filled this void!
"Real band like that! I used several band from eBay. However, this apple watch real band is great when compared them. Design and quality are awesome!"
"Nice , strong leather . Look beautiful & perfect for your Apple Watch . I’m highly recommend this product to everyone. Google job & thank you Apple."
Wasn’t sure I wanted or needed an Apple Watch but have really enjoyed having it. Realize I don’t need to carry my phone around all the time anymore.
Excellent Apple Watch. The Fitness part is the main factor of why I got the watch because it keeps track of my calories and how much I walk each day
I ordered these to have a little more color variety with my Fitbit Charge 3 and they are great! Easy to put on and off and nice colors. Recommended!
It helped with the clutter and the cords that would always fall off of night stand and nice view of Apple Watch at night for clock! Awesome product!
I wanted a more stylish everyday watch band and this one did the trick. It doesn\u2019t leave my wrist sweaty like the traditional Apple Watch bands
Loved it. Great watch while exercising. I would recommend this Apple Watch band to anyone that is going to buy an Apple Watch or needs a replacement
Preferred the full coverage of the bumper cover with top glass rather than purchasing separate bumper cover and glass to protect face of apple watch
Apple Watch charger works great. I like that it has a white side to it so it doesn\u2019t scratch the back of my watch. Good buy for a good product.
"This is my second Apple Watch, it was an upgrade from the series 3. It has a few new features. I will always say Apple products are a bit expensive."
Even though it is a Series 3 Apple Watch. It works great and definitely serves the purpose for which I purchased it. Extremely happy with this item.
I purchased this to replace my Samsung gear 2 which lasted over 4 years. I love the new look and features this watch has. Definitely agreat upgrade!
For an Apple Watch this one is by far the best especially with the Nike option and the GPS function without needing the phone to be connected to it.
I bought Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS) 38mm Silver Aluminum Case with White Sport Band - Silver Aluminum.\nThe product looks and performance is awesome
My daughter loves her Apple Watch a must have for your teenager Our whole family lives Apple products and service with Apple you can\u2019t go wrong

"I love my fitbit versa 2. It has more features than need. I especially love the fireworks on the display screen after getting 10,000 steps in a day."
Awesome product! Works just like my Apple Watch for a fraction of the price! Will be buying a few for Christmas gifts this year. Battery life great!
I have to say I love my Apple Watch I had The first generation before this one. But I love all the upgrades they did to it. Are use mine to workout.
"So hard to believe that it has so many features. It will take me a while to learn all of the features. I just ordered the ""Apple Watch for Dummies""."
I am so happy with my Apple Watch. This is my second purchase of an Apple Watch from Best Buy Both got it at a discounted price. Thank you Best Buy!
Purchased this for the ecg feature. I\u2019ve loved all the extras over my Fitbit. I do miss the battery life & sleep monitoring of my Fitbit Versa.
I was upgrading form my Apple Watch 2 as a gift to myself for a personal anniversary. I love the extra features and not relying on my phone so much.
I have been looking for something to protect my apple watch. This is soft and does a good job. I like that it is clear to see the color of my watch.
"MY PREVIOUS APPLE WATCH WAS THE ORIGINAL. THIS WATCH IS A MAJOR UPGRADE WITH GREAT BATTERY LIFE , FEATURES, AND THE ABILITY TO GET THE NEW UPGRADES."
I\u2019ve been eyeing an Apple Watch that fitted my budget for a long time. I\u2019ve finally found one and couldn\u2019t be happier with the watch.
"I purchased this Apple watch for my BB wife and she raves about it daily. She\u2019s impressed with it\u2019s battery life, comfort and ease of use."
I love my Apple Watch series 5! It is easy to use and has a lot of options that I really enjoy! My experience with this watch has been great so far!
I've been told I couldn't have given a better gift the now owner of the fitbit versa 2 loves it and has already set it up for their own personal use
"Sleep tracking is good and the sometimes adds steps when I get up, the battery doesn't last 6 days but overall I'm really enjoying my fitbit versa 3"
As a regular apple watch user this is well needed for the type of work I do. The ability to access my text messages without actually using my phone.
I love this ‘on the go’ charger for my Apple Watch! It keeps my watch from turning itself off when I’ve forgotten to fully charge it in the morning.
This band enhance the look of my Apple Watch. I like that it’s magnetic and easy to put on. Will definitely buy this product again in another color.
"Love the apple watch bands, the way they buckle to is easier and secure. The price on them is a little much in my opinion, but that's Apple for you."
"I have had the first generation Apple Watch, the 3, and now the SE. Picked the SE over the 6 because I didn’t need all the health features of the 6."
"so i have an apple watch as well and i truly appreciate this watch i only have to charge it once a week, it is very accurate, and the app is amazing"
"I love the Fitbit Inspire HR I like the way it fits my wrist, small and slender. It arrived on time and just as it was explained in the description."
"Beautiful for my Apple Watch. Great material and looks great. I also have it in white and compared to other bands, these ones feel very confortable."
"I have used Fitbit Charge before. This is an updated version. It is quite improved. It helps mectrack steps, exercise, sleep, heart rate and others."
"High build quality that Apple is known for. Infinitely adjustable fit works well for me. And it looks really nice, instantly makes the Apple Watch \"
"Great watch for what I needed. Did not need all the flash of an apple watch, just something to get my messages while I was on the podium presenting."
I just love these Nike bands. I have tried other brands and also aftermarket bands as well. None of them last like the Apple Watch Nike versions do!
Was not aware that the Apple Watch needed a special charging brick. Was really grateful when the sales representative told me that and showed me one
Love this watch! I have wanted to get an Apple Watch for awhile and I finally decided to get this one. Easy to set up and use. Better than expected.
I bought this watch as an alternative to the Apple Watch. It did not work when I received it and never charged or turned on after charging all night.
Bought this for my wife\u2019s Apple Watch and it\u2019s just a little plastic that I don\u2019t think protects it much. $15 is way to pricey for it.
Apple watch case is of low quality. The coating on the case chipped off the case the first day. This makes the device have a poor quality appearance.
"it connects easily with the app. Right after i bought this, the fitbit ionic watch died, absolutely no help from fitbit and horrendous phone support."
This band looks good but it’s very heavy and snaps on hair. Also it’s not waterproof. The one that comes with the Apple Watch is the best one so far.
Good tracker I liked the versa 2 just as well But if you want all of the extra bells and whistles this is a good device for less than an Apple Watch.
Work great! I didn't know if i would like having an apple watch and i don't know how to use it completely but I'm learning and enjoying the benefits.
"I like this apple watch band because is easy to put on and off, and it lends the watch a nice tech look. The material is soft, durable, and playable."
Love this Apple Watch! Only down side is the icons & time on the screen is smaller than the series 4. I like a bigger display of what I’m looking at.
It provides good coverage and actually hides minor scuffs that are visible on the Fitbit charge 3. The screen is just as responsive as its ever been.
"Got these to walk with on Apple Watch 5. Pairing was a breeze. Sound is very good. Had a few instances of cutting out, but not a hindrance. Good buds"
This is my second Samsung watch. The Active 2 is even better and easier to use than my previous Samsung Gear Pro 2 which I had for 3 years and loved.
Liked all the new features that yhis version of the apple watch came with this time ... compared to the apple watch 3 that i have had for a while....
"Helps protect the edges of my Apple Watch, but it oxidizes quite quickly as well. Ended up taking it off as I'm not reckless with said watch anyways."
I can not say enough about my Apple Watch. As a senior knowing my oxygen level and heat rate is important. Also I am very motivated to close my rings
Great product for an active but not overly active individual. Love the app to connect and track activity and steps. Better price than an Apple Watch.
"LOVE LOVE LOVE my Apple Watch, this is the second one I have purchased just to be able to have the updated version, gave my first one to my daughter."
The The Apple Watch our second one. My wife’s screen just opened up. Had to purchase a new one. I hope this one does not open up some battery issues.
Helps me keep track of my health and I have lost a lot of weight. It’s awesome and I highly recommend it. Had an Apple Watch before but perfect this.
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. This Fitbit Versa has motivated me to get moving. I'm now walking on my treadmill every morning 5X a week.
I wanted an extra watch charger for my Fitbit Charge 4 for use in the car or for traveling. This is exactly what I needed and quality is as expected.
The Apple Watch 3 is a fantastic watch because you can send text messages from it and call and use the walkie-talkie feature and it tracks your steps
I just love it. The Apple Watch that worths every dime My mom loved it since it was a gif for her birthday It also has an extra band for bigger hands
Bought this open box when I received it it was practically new absolutely love my Apple Watch. Keeps you accountable for getting and staying in shape
There’s no better fitness tracker/smart watch than the Apple Watch. I’ve used ever Apple Watch generation in my fitness journey in losing 100 pounds.
"Good value for the watch. Reliable and does the job. If you aren\u2019t looking for an Apple watch that has every feature, highly recommend this one!"
"Love my Apple Watch! Received it as a Christmas gift, and ended up going back to get the same one for my 16 year old son. Works great and looks nice!"
Gift I purchase for husband. He love this Fitbit Versa 2 Smartwatch. he said features on watch is similar to Apple watch without the Apple price tag.
it's a game changer for your apple watch. The phone charger is just a bonus but this allows your watch to charge without flying off your night stand.
"I used it for my Fitbit Charge 4. Very good fit, easy to apply, and so far, it has performed well despite scratching against hard and rough surfaces."
Apple Watch is the perfect gift for my wife she\u2019s ver happy with this product excellent . Thank you Best Buy to help me to fine the perfect gift
"We have 4 in use on our house. Never had any issued with any of them. Wish they would make a multi charger for Apple watch, AirPods as well as phone."
"This is my first Apple Watch and I am LOVING it. Easy to use, great apps and features. I especially love that Apple Fitness came free for six months."
"excellent warm handle, its grip is very similar to the original apple, also the coupling with the Apple Watch is perfect, the color remains with use."
"The Fitbit Charge 4 tracks my steps, monitors my heart rate, notifies me to try to get 250 steps/hour; putting it succinctly\u2014it keeps me active."
I have an Apple Watch 4 that is still is great condition because of how durable this case is! Why would you not want to protect it?! And great price!
Love my Apple Watch as it integrates with my phone and computer. It tracks my physical activities very well and motivates me to work harder each day.
Only reason I don’t use my Fitbit any more is because I upgraded to a Apple Watch but it did everything I needed it to do when it came to working out
"Worth the buy it is simple, beautiful and great quality. I got this for $25 and i am seriously impressed it looks just like an apple watch! Thank you"
Great quality Apple Watch band. Comfortable and sporty. Bought it on sale so good deal regular price a little expensive but you get what you pay for.
Perfect material that stays cool and no issues attaching it to the Apple Watch screen. Great sizing and much better than the band that comes with it.
I bought this new Apple Waych for my wife\u2019s birthday to replace an Apple Watch 3. She loves it! The new screen is much nicer and easier to read.
After 2 other smart watches I decided to get the Apple Watch. It was easy to set up and had tons of extra features. Like the workout and health apps.
I so love my Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2! It seamlessly connects to my phone and makes working and interacting with my phone a breeze! Get you one!
Purchased this to protect my Apple Watch. This was on sale so I purchased it and it’s been on my watch since it arrived. This is a good looking item.
Great size and superb battery life. This is for those that do not want a big Apple Watch but just something to keep track of calories and heart rate.
My son has been wanting an Apple Watch so he finally got one. This watch is perfect for him without me having to pay extra for a 5 series works great
I love my apple watch like i loved my past ones. Upset i can the reward points for it. I dont know why i keep buying my apple products from best buy.
Received a new Apple Watch as a birthday gift. Needed a wall charger. Best Buy had the charger in their store and I was able to purchase it that day.
"Needed a new Apple Watch, so I decided to go with the stainless steel version I’m glad I did, I love the weight and feel of the Apple Watch series 7,"
The touch screen for the watch is very nice. The app screen is exactly like Apple Watch screen which my son likes a lot. The screen also very bright.
"I loved my original series 2 Apple Watch and I love this one so much more. I love how I can swim with it, I hated I couldn\u2019t with my other watch"
"Have had since Jan 2019, got a Fitbit Versa Lite and croaked after 4 months, went back to this watch and love it and can change out bands very easily"
"This is my first Apple watch and I am satisfied how well it works. It took a little getting used to, but now, i have no problem wearing it every day."
"I really like the Zagg products and feel this one is great for the Apple Watch. Easy to put on, stays on well, and Zagg has a great warranty program."
These are the BEST cords ever purchased. Have had one at least 4 years and it is in perfect condition! LOVE them. Wish they made one for Apple Watch!
"I really like how the watch looks like. it looks exactly like the newest apple watch, yet it is much more cheaper and has a much better battery life."
One of the best looking sport loops for Apple Watch! The brown and light blue are a killer combo with the orange accents picture don’t do it justice.
I just loved it. Perfect for me and for what I need. Works excellent. You won't need an apple watch. This is very complete. Easy to install and setup
This watch is the best I love the battery life an love being able to see who calls me just from my wrist it almost like having an Apple Watch love it
Better than the apple watch. I had the ape watch 3 days and it went back. It feels sturdy and high tech at the same time Looks great Awesome purchase
"Bought to go with an Apple watch 2 for my wife. The leather band was well made and looks great. Be sure to get the right size, hers was a 42mm watch."
I\u2019ve never owned an Apple Watch before and this thing was really helpful. I especially like how it\u2019s easy to use and it helps with fitness.
Super cute. I get non stop compliments. People always ask if that’s a Apple Watch. Because it looks different and makes people look twice at my watch
Got this for my borfriends birthday. He absolutely loves it. Resembles Apple Watch. Easy to program. Battery life is awesome. Would highly recommend.
"The Apple watch is very user-friendly and has motivated me to keep a regular exercise schedule. Also, allows me to be more aware of my sleep hygiene."
"How I wish I would have purchased one for my first Apple Watch. These are well made easy to put on bumpers, that have kept my watch I pristine shape."
Apple Watch came in perfect condition and works perfectly fine. I’m already loving it and feels very nice to have on. Delivered faster than I thought
I am so happy with my Apple Watch. This is my second purchase of an Apple Watch from Best Buy\nBoth got it at a discounted price. Thank you Best Buy!
"I wore a fitbit versa for 2 years so this is taking a little getting use to. I do like it, though! I am not much for change so it just takes a while!"
I bought the Fitbit ionic for my husband for Father\u2019s Day! He was very surprised and he loves it. It\u2019s an upgrade from his previous Fitbit.
"I had the 1st Apple Watch and have been hesitant to update due to price. Once I saw an open product at a discounted price, I bought it. Was like new."
Got this as a present for my mom and she loves it. The Apple Watch just had too many features for her that she didn’t want or need. This was perfect.
"Love it, looks like apple watch,.does almost same as an apple watch without apple watch price. Simple watch, bought cover and stretch band fr amazon."
A cheaper version of the Apple Watch bands for a great price. Not as thick as the Apple Watch bands but fits exactly the same and the color is great.
"Who needs an Apple watch when you can get this.... it's really comfortable, accurate, and the app is easy to use... it stays charged for over a week!"
This worked beautifully and saved my Fitbit Charge 4. I am so happy with this product and the fit is perfect. Thank you for saving me time and money.
"Works with all new, and old Apple wireless charging goodies (except Apple Watch). It's small, and light, and fits in pockets and small bags. Love it."
Definitely a really good watch cover. I dropped my watch a few times and it protected it very well. I highly recommend this to any apple watch wearer
"I like this product because I can charge my phone, AirPods and my Apple Watch ! \nBest part is I can keep my phone case on my phone while it charges."
"Love the Apple Watch, this is my second Apple watch. Connects to Apple devices fast & easy. Battery life is long & only have to charge it once a day."
A must have if you own a Apple Watch! This case will take a beating. This may be my absolute best purchase ever and for the price you can’t go wrong.
Love this watch...and all the bells & whistles! Better than Fitbit. Charge doesn't last long bur I charge it before I leave the house in the morning.
"I have had a Fitbit charge, charge 2,versa, and now versa 3. I love my versa 3. I never want to take it off My coworkers all have bought one as well!"
I like the color but was hoping it had a little rose color but i like that it’s not the shiny sliver color. This is my 4th apple watch and love them.
Fitbit Versa 2 is very simple and not sophisticated to use unlike the iwatches. very comfortable for someone who does not like sophisticated gadgets.
This is a great band for my Apple Watch. It is as nice as Apple bands and save me a lot of money. I would highly recommend this watch band to others.
"Good cheap watch not gonna be as good as the apple watch, garmin, or Samsung but it's also super cheap and battery lasts for days and charges quickly"
"I have had multiple smart watches including Garmin and Apple Watch, but Fitbit is the best out there to track health, excercise AND sleep hands down!"
The new Apple Watch is very similar to the previous one I had. I’m happy I upgraded. Love that I don’t have to have my phone nearby for call anymore.
"My favorite Apple Watch Sport Band color. More of an aquamarine blue than green. I got it for about $10 off, which made it a better value than usual."
I chose 5 stars cause I truly like how it works with the phone and I can send text with it. I can also listen to music. This is my first Apple Watch.
Love this apple watch and the stainless steel mesh band. I really enjoy screening my cell phone calls as well as all the neat apps and face displays!
My husband really likes this band for his Apple Watch. It’s super light weight. It is also very easy to clean which is great since he works outdoors.
This watch band was easy to install on my Apple Watch. I had to shorten the watch band and it was easy to shorten. It is a beautiful rose gold color.
I loved my Apple Watch but it shattered so easy after a year and it’s no longer under warranty. I may try a different smart watch that’s more durable!
I dropped my apple when I was going to put it on and the screen shattered. It cost me $300 to get the apple watch replaced. Absolutely useless product
I bought this because my Apple Watch charger was not working. Watch portion is just a holder for the Apple Watch charger. I am returning this product.
Fitbit - Inspire 2 FitnessTracker - Lunar White is not good. It is a hard to set. My son tried to help me but not possible. I return back.Hard to set!
Horrible Cheap knock off Buy the Apple Watch At least with Apple you know your data is secure and protected O2 could only be read 1 out of 10 attempts
"It\u2019s a nice looking watch, almost all the apps are third party apps. No google play store. Switched to an Apple Watch and their is no comparison."
Great watch for the price but I returned mine for a cellular Apple Watch but for what kind of features it has its slightly cheaper than an Apple Watch
Upgraded from my previous Apple Watch Series 3 and very satisfied with everything. I love the always on display. A must to anyone with busy lifestyle.
"Love the FitBit inspire 2. I wasn’t sure about the sleep tracking, but I really find it very helpful. The mobile app is so easy and convenient to use,"
I\u2019m pleased with my Apple Watch. I was first skeptical about getting one but now I\u2019m wondering how I\u2019ve been procrastinating getting it
Highly recommend if you are looking to buy an apple watch or upgrade your old one. The always on display is nice and the battery is very long lasting.
Awesome watch. I had a Apple Watch 3 but I couldn’t get all of the medical apps that comes with the Apple 6. They are easy to use and the blue is cool
I had an earlier series apple watch without the cellular. I like the cellular so I can connect with family while on walks and runs if the need arises.
Absolutely love my Apple Watch! The employees at Best Buy helped me to pick out the perfect one for me. They were so patient with all of my questions.
Awesome purchase. On sale this is a great purchase. Changed the look of the watch. Attaching and detaching is also easy. Must buy if have Apple watch.
"Great quality and looks like it was made for the Apple Watch! I like to mix it up between this wine, the metal mesh one and the silicone bands I have."
"It's an Apple watch. Let the YouTube reviews speak for themselves. It does everything I need it to, battery is good, and the oem band works just fine."
This is one of the best choices I have made in a long time. This Apple Watch Nike Series 6 is every bit worth the money. I LOVE IT... It is awesome!!!
The Band fits great! Very comfortable. No problems attaching to my Garmin Approach S60. I like this band better than the one that came with the watch.
"Was thinking of series 6 but too $$$, saw this and never looked back. Most of my friends have an apple watch and never understood why, but now I know."
My husband loves his new FitBit Versa 2 Smartwatch. It does so much more than his last FitBit smartwatch. It holds a charge longer and looks nice too!
I switched from apple watch to galaxy and i dont regret it for a second . It loos awesome the battery life it is amazing And i love the quality of it.
"It looks sharp - simple clean design. Easy to put on. It fits the 38mm Apple watch perfectly, and also fits my wife's wrist.\n\nThe color is gorgeous!"
My mother-in-law loves her new apple watch and can't stop showing it off. this is truly an amazing piece of technology and it has a great battery life
This is my second Apple Watch. I really have enjoyed it. I am pleased that this one is waterproof and allows me the opportunity to use while swimming.
Great value! First Apple watch. Love the ability to get text and email alerts. Can take phone calls right from my watch leaving me to stay hands free.
Love my Apple Watch! I get all my notifications I would on my phone and can return messages back right from the watch. It’s not bulky and looks great.
"An awesome product. Received as a gift. Never thought that I wanted or needed an Apple Watch, until I received one. Now, I can\u2019t live without it!"
Strong strap. Felt durable and easily cleanable. Got this because the one which came with fitbit versa lite broke. 3 set strap is good value for money
"I would recommend this for it's price and functionality. Interface is easy to use and has better capabilities then the Apple Watch, which I also have."
Works as expected. Keeps Apple watch fully charged.\nEasy to set up.\n\nDisplay dimming feature is nice. Keeps bedroom from being too bright at night.
Genuine leather Apple watch strap for an excellent price. Fits 44m Series 6 Apple Watch perfectly. The pink color goes very well with gold color case.
Love this product! Have had this apple watch for a couple years and really enjoy it. Works great for checking messages and tracking physical activity.
Love the new features that the Apple Watch brings. I like that light deems during night and it keep track of your sleep this feature comes very handy.
Super easy to use and I feel that they protect my expensive Apple Watch. It does collect a bit of dust but I can easily take it off and wipe it clean.
I replaced the Fitbit charge 2 with the 3. It is easier to set your activity with the charge 2. Too many swipes to set start your activity and end it.
This was super easy to use. I went from having an Apple watch to this and I love it. I am an avid runner and the GPS was soooo much better than Apple!
"Great watch! Coming from a non Apple Watch, this is a huge upgrade and love it. Display is fantastic and very easy to setup. Works well with my phone."
"This product came on time, in great shape and is exactly what we needed to look organized and provide an area to charge our phone and new Apple watch."
"Great product! It works like an Apple Watch, tracks my steps, workouts, sleep, water and my food. You can check the weather and receive text messages."
Perfect Upgrade! I had a series 1 apple watch forever and decided to treat myself. I definitely don't regret this purchase. Love all the new features.
These bands are great they fit perfectly with the FitBit Versa and are exactly like their bands but at a fraction of the cost. Would highly recommend!
"The original charger for my Fitbit versa 1 broke, so I bought this to replace it. It looks exactly the same, and has worked great so far. Great price."
I have been debating getting an Apple Watch for years and I am so glad I did. I plan I’m giving this one to my son and upgrading to the newer version.
I absolutely love my apple watch! Ive had it for over 2 years now and have had no issues. Its super convenient and I love the fitness tracking option.
Wow this is a great watch. I barely got the fitbit versa 2 6 months ago but when this went on sale I had to jump on it. Looks functions are exquisite.
I am very happy with the Apple Watch! I use it for some many things. The only down side is the battery life if you are using all of the functionality.
This band was better than the band that came with my FitBit Charge 2! I feel that it will last longer than the band that came with my FitBit Charge 2!
I love the new Apple Watch. It\u2019s big enough that I can see the screen. It\u2019s worth the price and it\u2019s different from the old Apple Watch
I had a Fitbit Versa that was replaced 3 times in 1 year. Made the jump to Apple Watch and so happy I did so many more options! I highly recommend it!
This was an upgrade for my very archaic Apple Watch that was almost 6 years old. It offers everything from the previous generation in a higher quality
this thing does it all! Not an apple watch!!!!!!! If you are an athlete outdoor adventurer or in general just an sports/ fitness enthusiast its great.
I wish that I had purchased a replacement band for my Fitbit Charge 2 much earlier. The color is very vibrant. It is easy to put on and wash to clean.
The Apple Watch has reminders to keep you going. I bought it for heart monitoring and the activities movement recordings. I love it It keeps me going.
My favorite thing about this watch is the battery life! It lasts infinitely longer than my husbands Apple Watch It’s very comfortable and easy to use.
This bumper compliments my gold Apple Watch very well and has saved my watch from more than a few scratches. (I’m accident prone!) I highly recommend!
"Love the Fitbit versa 2, got it as a birthday present. Wear it everyday . Tracks my steps during the day helps me move more. Love the features it has."
I work with kids and at time I\u2019m not able to reply to my message on my phone. The Apple Watch comes in handy to reply or to see my notifications.
"Really good quality for not being an Apple product, holds up well and charges my Apple Watch 4 with zero issues. Much cheaper that what Apple charges."
nice inexpensive Apple Watch charger - worked for my wife in a pinch when she forgot her charger after heading out of town - curbside pickup is great!
GIFTED TO MY WIFE FOR HER BDAY AND SHE WAS ECSTATIC WHEN SHE OPENED HER PRESENT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THE Apple Watch RATHER THAN ANY OTHER WANNA BE. <3
"The watch is user friendly, very basic, light weight, and easy to bind to my phone. I got two and love how its not heavy and resembles an apple watch."
"Apple Watch series 5 is excellent watch , give you better heart rating, do breathing excerise also I like it it and it also says it’s time to stand up"
I purchased this hoping it would double as mouse pad as well stop my Apple watch from banging on the edge. This is more than I expected for the price.
"These are very good “bumper” style protectors for your Apple Watch. I get mine dirty at work and while exercising, so I replace them every 2-3 months."
"Upgraded from a Fitbit Blaze. Approximately 5 day battery life, which is why I picked this over an Apple Watch. Many options for clock faces and apps!"
My hubby loves this watch. Easy to use. The battery last forever. I have to charge my Apple Watch every other day. This watch last for almost 2 weeks.
I love the Apple Watch. It is comfortable to wear. The Nike band is great. It is easy to clean and it secures the watch to my wrist. Highly recommend!
Never thought I’d buy an Apple Watch but the price was right for the time and I got it and now I use it to track my activity and ensure I stay healthy
I waited a long time and finally purchased an Apple Watch. It is one of my best purchases ever. It\u2019s features are unending. I absolutely love it!
It's a really good product for the deaf / HOH people!! Especially when you get notifications on the Apple Watch that vibrates when you get the signal!
I love my Apple Watch. I\u2019m glad I bought it. I don\u2019t have to keep pulling out my phone to find out who is calling and I can respond to text.
"I love this Apple Watch, especially the heart monitor. I am 69 years old and it gives me peace of mind. I have a medium wrist and the 40mm is perfect."
"Wanted to upgrade our daughter to an Apple Watch to communicate with her phone better but didn’t want the huge price tag. This was the perfect option,"
"Love my headset. Its a big upgrade from the Samsung Gear. My only advice is for you to buy a halo headset, the one they provide is very uncomfortable."
Purchased Modal Silicone Watch Band for Apple Watch 44 mm - Blue. Daughter loves it. Durable. Water resisent. Bought 2 different colors liked so much.
Everyone should have an Apple Watch. My most used app is google maps. I’d get lost in my own backyard if I didn’t have it. I did buy a different band.
"Apple Watch is great, helpful when I work out, and tells me when to breathe. Especially when I’m on the road. Sins I drive manual car Definitely helps"
I purchase a Fitbit Versa 2 watch and I’m happy with the price and the service I received from the associated. She was very knowledgeable and friendly

"This band is really good for an Apple Watch, my wife really loved it. It definitely works as a band for the Watch. I would recommend this to a friend."
I have had a Fitbit Charge 4 since last summer. I got this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it too! Best workout/health tracker I\u2019ve had!
I am so happy with my new Fitbit Inspire 2. It’s just what I needed! It’s slim and sleek! The battery holds a charge for a long time. Get yours today!
Works great for a quick charge. LEDs are not super bright which is nice. Wish the cable was USB-C to the charger and it worked better with Apple Watch
Love my Apple Watch! Young lady who help me did an outstanding job. She knew everything about the product and even priced matched one of the products!
I purchased the Fitbit Charge 4 to replace my Apple Watch. It’s a nice little watch but when the next Apple Watch comes out in the fall I will get it.
The Apple Watch was long overdue for a refresh. I upgraded from my series 4 to the ultra and it’s a welcomed change. Love the design and the features.
"Great battery life. I can usually get three days of solid use per charge. The size is big, but it does feel big on the wrist. My best Apple Watch yet."
Really like this Fitbit Sense! I had a Fitbit charge and love this one even more! Helps me to keep moving more and keeps me motivated to be healthier!
Had to replace my Wife\u2019s Apple Watch as she couldn\u2019t go a week without it and She\u2019s very happy with it for managing Her daily lifestyle
I absolutely love this Watch! It is my first Apple Watch and I am obsessed. The band is super comfy also and I am so glad I chose this particular one.
Did not work for Apple Watch SE even though the description said it should. There is a black band around the edge which covers part of the new display.
"These did not work for me on my Apple Watch. It is just a plastic sticky cover and is easy to come of, which it has already. Back to the drawing board."
This Fitbit Versa 3 no longer charges & works. Dead after just 6 months of normal use. Bought for a friend’s birthday. Unfortunate mistake to purchase!
That was not good at all. Maybe it is work for someone but it was slow and it was not useful for me. I returned it and i purchased apple watch instead.
Mood feature doesn’t work. Wrist hurt if I wear it too long. Lack of feedback on the device makes it hard to track progress etc unlike the Apple Watch.
No complaints with this product at this time. I bought it as a gift for my daughter who didn’t want an Apple Watch. But she loves it. Mommy knows best.
Bought this to replace my Fitbit Versa 2 and try something different. It's great for workouts and seems more accurate. Lack of touchscreen is annoying.
"Looks great on the rose gold Apple Watch. The only downside is that the material that it is made out of is not breathable, so sweat builds up under it."
love this watch! I upgraded from a series 1. It runs so smooth and flawlessly compared to series 1. It feels like what the Apple Watch was meant to be.
I got this item for my mother's new apple watch and it is a very nice quality band that looks like it would be expensive but is not actually expensive.
"Easy to use ... I was never a fan of the apple watch, but not absolutely love it ... Special when I'm at my work don't need to carry my phone around..."
All good except color quality of screen… awesome watch over just disappointed on that area. Colors are washed out and not brilliant like an Apple Watch
"The band wasnt long enough for my wrist and the screen isnt as responsive as it should be. However, this version is a big upgrade from fitbit charge 2."
"Love my galaxy, switch from apple watch and its 100 times better. Not stuck in apples outdated ways paying outrageous prices for limited customization."
Sorry my last FitBit Versa 2 dies and needed to be replaced. Have an issue that I cannot seem to resolve. Watch face shows degrees C. I want degrees F.
Love my Apple watch it keeps track of all my physical activity and i especially love that it lets me know when i have a text message or call coming in.
Fits easily on my apple watch and doesn’t interfere with the bands! Cheap but seems sturdy and gives me a peace of mind knowing my screen is protected.
"Updated my Fitbit (Charge 2) to the Versa, I really love it and have had no problems (been wearing it 2 weeks now) I love the flexibility of the Versa."
"Fitbit - Inspire 2 Fitness Tracker - Black was a great birthday gift. \nShipped quickly, easy to use, looks good, comfortable.\nWould you recommend it!"
"Very good case/band for the Apple Watch. Fits my new 6 series well, and I'm not as worried about dents or screen scratches as I was while it was naked."
Love my watch! I’m 70 years old and had a Fitbit that I really liked. Debated for over a year about getting a Apple Watch. Glad I finally got the watch
"It’s a great power strip for when I’m traveling. It has more than enough outlets for my phone, tablet, Apple Watch, Bluetooth speaker, and other items!"
Great deal on the stainless model I purchased. High quality product. 3rd Apple Watch and each upgrade is improvement. Battery life last all day for me.
My daughter recently got a new Apple Watch and her favorite color is this mint green. It was a good price and a perfect fit for her new series 3 watch.
I love the new Apple Watch series 6 I’ve had a series 3 & 4 but not one as good as the series 6 I also bought it used looked brand new great price too?
Got it for my wife as she\u2019s been wanting a blue replacement band for her Apple Watch 4. Had it for a while now and still in great shape. Good buy.
Not bad at all works perfectly fine for me. It\u2019s not the newest but I like it. Save some money Easy setup it\u2019s my first Apple Watch I love it
I have been using my Apple Watch for past few months and I absolutely love it. The battery life is good 15 hours and then it needs charging for 20 mins
I purchased this for my Apple Watch SE! Looks very clean and smooth! Doesn\u2019t look fake and plastic! Mine hasn\u2019t turn yellow or scratched yet!
Had to go back to have them set up my apple watch that I paid to have it hooked up to my other phone. Sales person was to busy to give me good service.
"My daughter loves it. It perfect for her active lifestyle. She love bouldering, rock climbing and hiking. It's a much better color for her apple watch."
Apple Watch. Does everything you expect it to. It\u2019s comfortable and easy to set up. Very pleased with the battery life of this watch. Looks great.
Love My Apple Watch . Ready to get the latest version when i have The funds to get. Recommend for anyone who likes to keep up with health and fitnesses
Love the Apple Watch. This is the third one I’ve had. They always get better. Much better choice to purchase from Best Buy rather than the Apple store!
Gifted to hubby for Xmas along with this new Apple Watch and he loves it. He said it feels so light that you hardly notice you\u2019re wearing a watch.
Loved this. Was a permanent fixture on my watch until I upgraded it recently. It was easy to use and attached quite readily to my 1st Gen. Apple Watch.
Great watch case and band. Protects my apple watch from water and scratches. Still using it over a year later. Great quality. Like the bulkyness of it.
This is a great acesessory for my Apple Watch.It fits perfectly and will allow me have some sense of peace that my phone surface will not be scratched.
"I have always loved the apple watch, this one is no different. The quality is unsurpassed and tech is top of the line. This was definitely a great buy!"
I was looking for a stand to charge my apple watch and liked the idea that I could still see the time on my watch while it is charging on my nightstand
It\u2019s a little tough to get the phone on the charger connection but it works great and I love that you can throw the Apple Watch on to charge also.
Pretty much like everything..simple to use..does exactly what I was hoping..have a lot of complaints on the Fitbit Versa 2 but none on these protectors
"Never thought I would use an Apple Watch. Since I got it, I use it everyday and feel lost without it. Very glad I finally decided to make the purchase."
It\u2019s easy to set up and to use. It\u2019s stylish as well. This is the second Apple Watch I have owned. The first one was passed down to my niece.
"The band that came with my FitBit Ionic had torn, so I was in need of a replacement. This item was perfect for just that. Color is exactly as depicted."
"This Apple Watch is great, and it's especially a good value for someone's first Apple Watch. The Apple Watch Series 3 is still snappy, and works great."

I love to change the band so it gives the feeling of a NEW apple watch :) I love the color of this band and keep changing between my other apple bands.
I love my Apple Watch it was an upgrade from the series 5. O love the bigger screen but love that the full keyboard comes up when responding to a text.
First I love the Apple Watch . I have been rocking since the very first addition. This band for my series’s 7 is amazing. It’s comfortable and stylish.
Apple watch series 3 is a great buy. Very easy to use and no issues with delay or lag on wifi. Works great my only regret is not buying the larger one.
Love it enjoying first time with a Apple Watch like the quality and design also purchase for two of my teen grandchildren for Christmas which they love
Waiting to see how it holds up.Sturdier than Apple Watch.Less expensive.I like the fit bit premium app.The battery life is better.Not sold on the band.
I love this Apple Watch. It works well for viewing items on your phone without reaching for the phone. Set up was easy enough and the Watch looks nice.

I opted for this Apple Watch out of need for health tracking rather than the phone features and its a great start... hopefullly it last for a long time
love this watch! I upgraded from a series 1. It runs so smooth and flawlessly compared to series 1. It feels like what the Apple Watch was meant to be.
I\u2019m in love with my Apple Watch I use it more for exercises to track my step and calories... I would definitely recommend this to everyone love it
Great workout tracker with the nice display. I'm very satisfied with the purchase and glad to have saved extra dollars on buying Fitbit or Apple Watch.
Bought this for my son. He loves it. Does exactly what it says. Most do not work on iPhones unless it’s an Apple Watch but this one does. Great product
Best Apple Watch by far!!!! Love it! A beautifully built piece. Love that the watch displays time without you having to lift arm. Best watch out there.
"Had Apple Watch since Series 2 and upgraded to Series 4. Highly recommend. GPS much better for runs, battery life greatly increased. Worth the upgrade."
The Apple Watch series 5 is a great watch. Love the features and options. To be able to text is amazing. I can see things at a glance. Love this watch!
This watch band is very comfortable. It looks great with my silver Apple Watch. The color is beautiful and looks great on. Great combination of colors.
I am very happy with new fitbit charge 5. It is very comfortable to wear it on my wrist and display is really nice.\nThis is pretty tough item as well!
Got this for my wife and she loves it. App works great and is easy to use. When you use the product it gives you credit for mindfulness on Apple Watch.
The Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable quickly charges my watch. I bought an extra to keep in my office so I can charge if I forget to charge at home.
"Purchased an Apple Watch for my wife\u2019s birthday, she absolutely loved it. Watch works great, battery life could be better, but not a deal breaker."
This Apple Watch is perfect for my needs. I am Able to easily keep up with emails texts and notifications without constantly pulling out my cell phone.
Had a few issues getting Apple Watch to charge. working normally now. Just have to make sure it is connected properly (very touchy). Works as it should
cannot beat the price . Beats the apple watch by a mile in overall value. Does most of what everyone needs. Charges in an hour and charge lasts a week.
Bought this and the Fitbit charge 4 for my wife. I let her decide which one to keep. She liked this one more. This band is more comfortable and for a \
This is a great quality Apple Watch band. The leather is sturdy and the band is durable. I like it better than any band I’ve bought for my Apple Watch.
Purchased for family member who damaged a Fitbit Versa 2. More features and greater versatility with this new Versa 3. Family member loves this device.
Looks heavy duty smartwatch like a GShock and I only have to charge once every two weeks instead of everyday like an Apple Watch! Definitely recommend!
"A big upgrade for me from my Apple Watch 3rd series. I’m loving the smoothness of it when using multiple apps, no lag. I really like the color as well."
I absolutely love my Apple Watch fits perfect as I have a small wrist very satisfied with this purchase so thanks for having what I wanted for so long!
Works as described. This is a relatively inexpensive solution for the need to purchase a different more expensive charging cube for the new Apple Watch
"It's reasonably priced, does everything an Apple Watch or Fitbit can do. I especially like the SMS notification feature. Highly recommend this product."
I had to replace 2 fitbit Versa bands in 1 year after having a Timex Triathlon for 4 years with the same band. I'm assuming the real profit is in bands.
Bought for my husband\u2019s Apple Watch. It broke trying to put it on. It has money back guarantee but the shipping and handling was $10. Not worth it!
The clasp did not stay fastened. I purchased my Apple Watch and the next day it fell off my wrist and broke because the Next Band did NOT stay fastened.
"These bands do not fit the FitBit Versa. They are slightly too large, will not click into the housing for the band. Do not buy. Waste of time and money."
My Fitbit Versa 3 lasted only about 3 months. Since then it will not charge. Warranty was only good for 45 days. Cannot get help from Fitbit support!!!!
Good watch works great with galaxy phone. It doesn\u2019t have the same ease of use as the Apple Watch but it\u2019s the best watch for Samsung devices.
Great product! I love this Ionic even though it has a few glitches. Definitely recommend this over the over-priced Apple Watch to meet your basic needs.
Nice watch works OK on iOS. Can’t track as much as an Apple Watch and does occasionally disconnect but over all it serves it purpose and functions well!
It’s basically just like an Apple Watch does all the same features. Just wish I could talk into it to text. Otherwise I’m very happy with this purchase!
This zagg watch protector does a wonderful job of preventing scratches and cracks for your Apple Watch that you\u2019ve spent your hard earned money on!
"The bands are fine and fit my Fitbit Charge 2 perfectly. After a few months the ring that tucks in the rest of the band broke, so that's the only thing."
"I actually replaced my apple watch series 3 with this. It has so many more features and is much more lightweight. For the price, you just can't beat it."
The Series 5 Apple Watch is fairly simple to use. Navigation to find functions can be a little tricky at times. It's rather pricey but I bought on sale.
I'll start this review by saying I don't buy or promote Apple products exclusively. My phone is happily an Android and I don't own an Apple Watch or use
"Great smartwatch, but way too many bells and whistles for what I needed. I love the convenience of having an Apple Watch and plan to buy a older version"
"My third Apple Watch, the best one yet! I am still discovering features that were not on the first two. A little expensive but you get what you pay for."
The Apple watch Catalyst protective band is as advertised and is of top quality . Great product one of the best sales to protect you\u2019re Apple Watch
I love the way this tortoise band looks with my Apple watch! I’m very happy with the look and feel of it....this band gives my watch a little extra pop.
This is the most comfortable watch band I’ve ever worn. I own both the black and the brown so I can easily keep my Apple Watch in sync with my wardrobe.
"It’s pretty straight forward, it charges your any of the Apple Watch. \nThis is USB-c which practically is universal now . \nNicely built charging cable"
I absolutely love this band! Fits perfectly and no issues. What an awesome buy! Thank you for helping me decide which band to get for my Apple Watch Se!
"I absolutely love my Apple Watch. I upgraded from the series 1 so that I could have the updated feature, especially the heart monitor features. Love it!"
"Apple watch\u2019s are very useful specially when you have to multitask at work, you do not to physically pull your phone out to text back or call back."
Apple Watch 5 is a winner. I purchased it to replace my earlier model after two falls did my original in! I have found it satisfactory in every respect.
"My kid loves it. I got it for her for Christmas. It was between this or an apple watch, I\u2019d figured she\u2019d use this more often. She was stoked!"
I have been contemplating on getting an Apple Watch for sometime now. I am very pleased that I finally made the decision to purchase my new Apple Watch.
Great Product I\u2019ve had my Apple Watch for a longtime and has held up nice so I got my daughter one for graduation gift she\u2019s gonna be so happy
"At first, I thought I would never really use an Apple Watch but, once I got one, I haven’t looked back. It’s such an amazing and useful product to have."
"Truly life changing I wake up and know where my phone is at, I use it when I’m FaceTiming at home way harder for my little ones to unplug my Apple Watch"
This band is absolutely the bomb dot com. I like the closure as it is magnetic. I purchased this band to go with my son's new apple watch for Christmas.
"This is the second UAG band I have bought. I had one for my Samsung Active 2 and now for my Apple Watch Series 6. Very durable, comfortable and stylish."
Bought my wife her first Apple Watch.\nShe has been track her fitness New Year's resolution with the Applle Watch 6.\nShe is impressed by its functions.
Platinum™ - Horween Leather Band for Fitbit Inspire and Inspire HR - Copper is perfect for my Fitbit. I like to use other colors than the standard ones.
"I upgraded from the Apple Watch 1, I am happy with my purchase. I was able to get a good price due to it being on sale. I am exploring all the features."
It was great for the price. But I think that it wasn't protecting the apple watch screen itself only the outside. I bought another one a few days later.
An amazing band for my Apple Watch that blends well for my daily life and whenever I do work. It fits like a glove and doesn’t disappoint at all for me.
"Cant go wrong with an Apple watch, best quality amongst competitors and amazing new features. Highly recommend if your running or just need ease of use."
"This watch is beyond fantastic, and the person who helped me understand the differences between Apple Watch Series 5 vs. Series 6 was extremely helpful."
Shines just like real gold. Adds so much class to any Apple Watch.\nMy watch just went from just another tech device to a part of my jewelry collection.
I buy alot from Best Buy and this the one i love it adorable fit right on my apple watch together with tools so you can adjust that can fit on you wrest
My wife likes her apple watch a lot. The only issue is the all new fall detection. The SOS message pops up even if the catch is a little loose on hands.
"the band is so perfect it makes my apple watch feel so lightweight, it feels like I don\u2019t even have it on and the velcro makes it easier to put on."
It’s a good watch strap. A little hard to get use to it works backwards from what your use to with the original Apple Watch strap but you get use to it.
"Great alternative to Apple Watch if using for fitness, calorie counting etc. Synced it with the lose it app for counting calories. Lightweight and cute!"
"I’ve always wanted an Apple Watch, i use it more for work since I work in the medical field. Super easy and useful! I love it, and no regrets buying it!"
I've wanted an Apple watch for quite some time and decided to finally get one. I've been very pleased with all of the options you can do with the watch.
"I was worried my fitbit versa 2 wasn't compatible with Samsung note 8, but once my fitbit was fully charged everything paired just fine and I love it!!!"
I previously had the Fitbit ionic but it stopped charging after the warranty expired. I changed it up to the garmin and I\u2019m really liking it so far
"I can\u2019t believe I went this long before I got an Apple Watch! Great visuals, tracks my steps, can keep my phone in my purse and just use the watch!"
The Apple Watch has reminders to keep you going. I bought it for heart monitoring and the activities movement recordings. I love it \nIt keeps me going.
I have now owned the apple watch and this watch and I can honestly say they are very comparable to each other. I like the looks of this one more though.
Replaced a fitbit versa I got my wife a couple of years back and this is a much better unit. Easy to use and a much nicer fit for my wife. She loves it.
I have never owned a smart watch before … this is my diet time I purchase myself one and I’m glad I did and went with an Apple Watch and I’m loving it .
Bought 2 Apple Watch SE s. Open box to find out it’s no longer a standard usb connection. Two new power bricks $40 or 2 adapters $8. Which would you do?
Seems like a good fit for products for the Apple Watch. First time watch user so not sure what else you\u2019d have to be doing to ensure safety for it.
Pretty similar to the Apple Watch but affordable. Nothing to envy to this super expensive watches that cost a fortune. Easy to manage. Lovable pink band
The preferential price of this smart watch for kids is good for me enough comparing to the apple watch or Samsung one! This watch gives me what we need.
So far so good with this Apple Watch product. It tracks everything you do and the new health functions are great. Just wish the battery life was longer.
Love my watch. This is an Apple product that has lasted and I can\u2019t imagine not having an Apple Watch now. Will be buying another when this breaks.
"Works well to compliment my Apple Watch charger. However, it would\u2019ve been better if the Series 6 Apple Watch came with a power adapter of its own."
"It tracks a lot of features! I used to own a Fitbit charge, but it broke and I bought this. It works really well and tracks data better than the Fitbit!"
"Bought this for my husband who had a fitbit and he is very pleased. Not to mention, we all now have the Apple Watch which makes it easier to share tips."
This band is very comfortable and the ventilation holes make it great for use during exercise. I\u2019d highly recommend this band for your Apple Watch.
Sturdy. My Apple Watch charger fit perfectly! It’s great for keeping my watch charged and my phone in a place where I can find it. Well worth the price!
"Comfortable, just like an apple watch band. I had lost a Fitbit because of a band that came undone easily and so I'm not going to let this one get away!"
Excellent replacement band! Affordable and high quality with cute color choices. I have ordered several for my family members that have Fitbit Charge 2.
"I purchased it for my wife. She really liked the watch, but we returned it for an Apple Watch since was not really designed to work with Apple products."
I came into Best Buy to pick up a new Fitbit Versa after my previous one started having screen issues and tearing. So far so great! I just love Fitbits!
I just test this watch and it worth the price. It has more exercise options than Apple Watch. It lighter than apple watch and the battery life is great.
"My Apple watch is great. I like how it monitors my activities, prompts me to stand and breathe. The design is kool! IStill have a lot to learn about it."
Love these screen protectors for my Fitbit charge 3. Came very quick & very easy to apply. Detailed instructions were very helpful. Very affordable too.
After I got my Apple Watch my wife loved it. So I had to get one for her too. She loves it. She probably uses more of the different functions than I do.
The Nike Apple Watch Series 5 is awesome. The Nike Hybrid watch face is very nice. i like the many apps including the ECG. I purchased it for $100 less.
My boyfriend is a repair tech so I didn't want to get him an Apple Watch. He absolutely loves this product and can't wait to see the new one coming out.
My wife has been in love with her apple watch ever since she got it. She loves that she is able to use the various fitness apps for different exercises.
I upgraded from the first Apple Watch and I'm very pleased with my purchase! This is probably undoubtably the best smart watch on the market hands down.
Recently upgraded from an apple watch 1. Love the battery life on the 5! I can do multiple workouts and still have battery life at the end of the night!
"I purchased this plug to accompany an apple watch as a gift because it didn't come included with the watch. So far, so good - it works just as intended."
The product works as advertised. It takes a bit of time to get used to donning the strap on if you haven’t had an Apple watch before but it works great!
Love love love the Apple Watch series 3. Makes life easier not having to carry my phone and always looking at it when I’m unable to I can see who it is.
"This is my second Apple Watch. The first one I had for several years and wore every day. I like the new features, look and feel of this model. Very nice"
"This works just as well as the charger that comes with an Apple Watch. It’s a little bulky, sure, but it gets the job done and quickly charges my watch."
"Love the Fitbit Inspire 2 Fitness Tracker! It is easy to use and helps me keep track of steps, miles and heart rate. Just the thing to help be stay fit."
"Love my apple watch, I don't have any issues with the watch other then I wish they had more of a variety of free faces for the watch like Samsung Watch."
Makes the apple watch super easy for jumping in the pool and workouts. Also great for summer when your wrist swells a little from the heat and humidity.
This is a wonderful monitor. I love that I can see it on the screen it comes with but also on my phone wherever I am. It also works with my Apple Watch.
I never have a Apple Watch before this is my first one and I love it great product the only problem is the battery life but other than that no complaint
I love my new Apple Watch. I ca n check my heart rate and my check my heart for A Fib. It is awesome to have access to the ECG to check my heart rhythm.
I love my apple watch. So i surprised my mom with one for Christmas. She loves it. Tracks her moving calories and she helps her hit her goals i the gym.
Wanted an Apple Watch for a while but was hesitant I wouldn\u2019t like the bulk on my small wrists- this one fits great and I love all of the features!
This is my favorite charger. I use it in the car and on the go everywhere I go to charge my Apple Watch. It’s stunning. Easy to you and word like a pro!
This works well with the Apple Watch and hasn’t stopped working yet. Great if you need a backup charger and isn’t as expensive as the Apple branded one.
"Great deal, I use my Apple Watch everyday as a personal trainer and it is so helpful. I love using it to track workouts as well as compete with clients."
Oxygen meter are very accurate and heart rate reading are also accurate just like in my apple watch. Works very well for me and i really like it. Thanks
"This is my second Apple watch and I love it. My favorite feature is having my move,exercise and stand goal. It really keeps me on track with my fitness."
"This Fitbit - Charge 4 is working great for me. It sinks to the Fitbit app on my android. It seems to be accurate. I like this granite band, not sweaty."
Had to replace my old apple watch after it died from 7 years of daily use. This was a great replacement with obviously more features that my old one had
"tt 5.0 out of 5 stars I Switched to an Apple Watch and then I switched back because I love my Fitbit By Kari D. on October 7, 2022 Images in this review"
"Replaced my Apple Watch. I love this watch as I don’t have to charge every 1-2 days, it last 9-12 days. More customizations for workout and better stats"
"decent apple watch. Could use a bigger screen, but still a quality product. i would def recommend a protector since the screen is easy to scratch/crack."
The Apple Watch Series 3 is the OG. It is a good started watch for teens wanting an apple watch. Sleek design. Performance is great! No complaints here!
"This watch is worth every penny, is a lot better then the Apple Watch. the battery last really long time, Track your sleep really well, very nice screen"
"I’ve wanted an Apple Watch for a bit, so decided on this mid price option. LOVE IT! It does everything I want it to do, and then some. Highly recommend."
"Great wireless charging solution for those with apple watch, airpods and phone. Single cable (and transformer included), high quality feel to materials."
I am enjoying my new Apple Watch. There seems to be a lot more to it than I realized. I had a Fitbit before so I need to learn how I can use the watch .
"Very happy with the larger size screen, I have had an apple watch for many years. This is by far my favorite. Love the color and all the options it has."
"The Apple Watch SE is the sweet spot for features and value in the AW lineup I love this watch. It's got great functions, and the battery lasts all day."
It was not easy to put on the Apple Watch and then it kept hitting the side button and trying to call the emergency number! I Do not recommend this item!
"Waste of money. Says it works for fitbit charge hr, But the charger port did not fit properly in my fitbit. Actually started pulling my fitbit piece out."
I had to return it- it wouldn\u2019t charge two phones at the same time or if I charged my Apple Watch it wouldn\u2019t charge my phone at the same time.
Had to return this case. Did not expect it to be velcro if I remember correctly. Can't believe people would trust their apple watch to velcro connection.
"I think this is a great product for what it is. I was expecting something with almost as much functionality as an Apple watch, though and this is not it."
Does not hold phone in case. Wish the support hooks were wider or adjustable. Phone slides off with small wallet case on back. Apple Watch part is great.
I’ve been waiting to purchase an Apple Watch. So when it went on sale I purchased one. It makes it very convenient. I wish the battery would last longer.
It's fine. The screen is great and I didn't want something like an apple watch since it's not something I think I'd use fully. This is a good in between.
"Love this wireless charger for not only my phone, but my Samsung Gear S3! Just make sure the phone is sitting properly or it'll lose the wireless charge."
"I love the watch, but I’m disappointed in the graphics available for the Apple Watch. A previous Samsung watch had graphics which were many times better."
"The Fitbit Versa 2 works pretty good. The only problem is that it is too easy to access. For example, when I am showering the water activates everything."
I upgraded from the Apple Watch 3 and I have enjoyed it so far. The bigger screen is nice. The battery life may not be quite as good but it last all day.
"I love this to track the basic health indicators like heartbeats, blood pressures, calories. It does the majority of what an apple watch does. Thank you."
Some reviews say you don’t have to pay. Will probably send it back. My Apple Watch does pretty good. My Doctor says Cardio is better but it is expensive.
Love this app keeps me on track with my steps for the day and my heart rate pretty accurate I compared it with my husband’s Apple Watch and it’s spot on.
"Overall, I like my Apple Watch (after being a long-time Fitbit user). But some aspects are unnecessarily complex and I miss some of my Fitbit's features."
"It was the perfect gift for Mother’s Day literally said may wife!!! She loves it, all notifications arrive just on time on her Apple Watch!!! And more !!"
"This is actually my second Apple Watch, the first one was 42mm, this one is smaller. I prefer this smaller size because of how light it feels in my wrist"
"It\u2019s pretty straight forward, it charges your any of the Apple Watch. This is USB-c which practically is universal now . Nicely built charging cable"
Great little piece of technology. I had an Apple Watch model 3 so when I upgraded to 6 it was a huge difference. Loving it. The o2 level is a plus for me
I am enjoying my new Apple watch tremendously. The only thing that I do not like is that it needs to be charged daily. Two days of charge would be great!
"Really good watch, great built & the red color is beautiful looks very metallic. If your looking for an apple watch & you like red i recommend this watch"
Still trying to learn all the details of the features. But I do like it very much. So much information! I chose the Apple Watch rather than a Life Alert.
"Small, sleek and accurate. 5.0 out of 5 stars Fitbit Inspire 2. Love it! By Gemma Mart on April 18, 2021 Small, sleek and accurate. Images in this review"
As expected...this is my first Apple Watch. All I was looking for was a watch the linked to my phone...this fit the bill and the sale price was good too!
Fitbit charge 4 is working really well.took a while to get it set up though. If you have an older fitbit it trys to go back to the old one during set up.
"I have had apple watch for years, and this watch i thought from the size would be an issue but overall the watch is awesome, lots of features, and tough!"
"Love my Apple Watch! The size is great, the fit is perfect. I love that I can’t get quick notifications without having to have my phone out all the time."
I like my apple watch series 3 because I could receive all my notifications through it. Also it is easy to use and I also can record my exercise routine.
I absolutely love my Apple Watch Series 3. I use it for keeping track of my workouts among so much. I\u2019m totally addicted to it and wear it everyday.
This was a great deal bbut now im selling this to get an apple watch which was suppose to be a good experience until best buy set me a broken apple watch
"I love this so much more than the apple watch. This is easier to handle and has a lot more features, in my opinion. I am never going back to apple again."
Love this Apple Watch! It was my first watch purchase and it does everything I need it to! Helps me stay organized and keeps me active. Highly recommend!
I love everything about my Apple Watch Series 3! Motivates me to keep up my fitness goals and to keep productive. Best Watch Ever Invested In! Thank you!
"Brand New apple watch, had my series 1 42mm forever and just got this one for the 38mm size. Worth the price works flawlessly and came sealed in the box."
The Apple Watch Series 6 is feature-packed and definitely the best smartwatch available for iPhones. I only wish it had a week-long battery like fitbits.
I prefer original Apple watch bands. I got this one as a open box which is a plus. No problems with rashes as I do with knock offs. Soft and comfortable.
I\u2019m a big Apple fan so of course I love the Apple Watch. The 40mm option fits my wrist nicely and I enjoy having the compass feature on this series.
"Bought these for my oldest son that loves the color blue, and he was thrilled to be able to change Apple Watch color bands; both were Graduation gifts!!!"
They have a lot of new features already i got my first apple watch series 1 last 2016 and this is my 2nd apple watch i can say a lot of improvements done
Wear my Apple Watch all day everyday aside from quick charge once a day. Absolutely no complaints and since I\u2019ve gotten one I wouldn\u2019t go back.
Love love love my new fitbit ionic. The best fitbit I’ve ever had. Been a loyal customer for years and this is my 5th device and honestly is my favorite.
I got this for my husband because he felt like Apple Watch was making him look at his phone or wrist all the time. Wanted something to partial disconnect
I purchased this for my wife’s birthday and although refurbished it looked and works like my brand new Apple Watch! You can never go wrong with Best Buy!
Love it! It might not have everything the apple watch or fitbit has but it does what I want it too and the battery life is great! Would highly recommend!
super in love with my new apple watch s7. it’s been 5 years since i purchased one and i really didn’t wanna upgrade but upgrading was the best move ever.
Upgraded my wife’s Apple Watch to this version. Definitely love the bigger screen and all the new features. It is much more responsive then her 2 series.
"Works fantastic right out of the box, no complaints. Easy to use, and it's a Apple watch, I like the features that the SE came with at a reasonable price"
This cord is perfect with my Apple Watch. Does the job efficiently and it’s so portable too! The only thing I d change is to make it a little bit longer.
"This is the perfect bed side table and was easy to put on my bed. It is not huge, but I only had it for my phone and Apple Watch to charge while I sleep."
"Nice , strong leather . Look beautiful & perfect for your Apple Watch . I\u2019m highly recommend this product to everyone. Google job & thank you Apple."
"Apple Watch watch series 5 is by far the best Apple Watch. Great for health, notifications and everyday life. If you don\u2019t have one. It\u2019s time."
I had a samsung gear s3 and this Ticwatch has been pretty great. I wish it had better sleep tracking and wish the 2nd layer watch had some customization.
"I love it, for the price you can’t beat this, my husband has a Apple Watch still paying for it, it has a data plan, mine is just as good as a Apple Watch"
"Not going to lie, I was super against these at first. I decided to try them out while working and working out and they came in handy with my Apple Watch!"
Great addition to the Apple Watch. I ride motorcycles and this band stays tight through all the vibration and wind. Would not hesitate to purchase again.
Finally something that makes sense a charging station that will charge your Apple watch phone and earbuds all at the same time in one convenient location
"I got this Fitbit-Versa 2 as Christmas gift and I just love it.. So far it is awesome. It is much better than my Fitbit Flex, by far. Highly Recommended."
"My first Apple Watch and I love, love, love it! I'm a really big fan of apple products, so if you're thinking of purchasing you will not be disappointed."
"Love it. Small size, classic look of a watch not squared like the Apple Watch...tracks my sleep, steps during work and even heart rate.. pretty and good."
Had a Blaze for several years. I later went with the Apple Watch. Just recently switched back to the Fitbit. Glad I did the Versa 2 has not disappointed.
This is my 2nd FitBit Inspire HR and I just love it! I wear it all the time and don’t have to worry about it getting wet! I highly recommend this device!
love everything about this watch! This watch also works great if you own a Air Computer. This Apple watch can also unlock your laptop...how cool is that!
This watch is a lot like the apple watch missing a couple features but for the price nothing can match it. Connection was easy and overall use is simple.
"LOVE this watch, and the $50 discount Best Buy had was by far the best I’ve seen for a new Apple Watch anywhere. Easy to purchase and use BB for my tech!"
My boyfriend is a repair tech so I didn't want to get him an Apple Watch.\nHe absolutely loves this product and can't wait to see the new one coming out.
I love how my Apple Watch tells me when I need to take a break since my life is really chaotic. It\u2019s nice to get a reminder of when to take a break.
I am well pleased with my purchase of the Apple Watch Series SE. It’s is 8:34pm and I still have 83% battery life. With no extra charge since last night.
"The Apple Watch that I purchased from Best Buy is Excellent, I can talk on my apple watch while I’m at work, without stopping my work to answer any calls"
This was purchased for my wife's Apple Watch. She has been wanting this since before we purchased the watch. Should make her watch look that much better.
"Very high quality, I also own an Apple watch but am impressed with the features of this device. I really like the control mechanism using the large dial."
"As a replacement for a lost Charge 3, I am very pleased with the Fitbit Charge 4. It does all that I seek from a fitness monitor and looks great as well."
"Love this watch. I bought the original Apple Watch,?it still working today. I love the iWatch 6. It’s a fantastic watch and it has great health features."
I bought this apple watch nike SE 44mm as a gift to my friend. They loved it and are enjoying using this everyday. I would highly recommend this product.
This band enhance the look of my Apple Watch. I like that it\u2019s magnetic and easy to put on. Will definitely buy this product again in another color.
Super convenient for protecting Apple Watch. Bumped my watch into table and wall a few times but no damages thanks to this. Glad the purchase was useful.
My girlfriend loves it. 40mm was perfect for her too. I’ve had an Apple Watch for over 2 years myself and this one seems to do even more. I recommend it.
I love the apple watch. It does everything I expected it to do. I bought this one because my series 2 watch broke and thought it was time for an upgrade.
Pretty nice watch. Had a Fitbit before..if you only like fitness related stats maybe stay with Fitbit but for all overall functions Apple Watch is better
"The Apple Watch is great! Especially in the stainless steel variance. If you're planning on keeping it for 3+ years, then spend the money and get the SS."
I purchased a clear bumper to help protect my new Apple Watch. I really appreciate that it’s clear so that the watch’s attractive color is still visible.
I love my Fitbit Versa 3 User friendly with loads of information. Just purchase a new band and you have a new style. Keeps me honest about my activities.
This is a great tool for adjusting watch band link size. I have a few watch bands to use with my Apple Watch and this tool saves my fingernails and time!
Everybody just love this bracelet! It’s comfortable and very stylish. I would most definitely recommend this to all Apple Watch females that likes style.
"Huge upgrade to the old Apple watch she had. Stylish and works flawless. Seems to be well made, so far. No complaints from her which is a big deal...lol."
"Never had an Apple Watch, bought the series 3 for a starter. I really like it, very comfortable, easy to use. Battery life not an issue. Would recommend."
"When am I going to learn my lesson, Fitbit’s last under a year and in the case of my new Fitbit Charge 5 it only lasted a month. I’m over Fitbit for good."
Clasp fell apart losing my $400 apple watch. Lucky a was able to find to with the apple location on phone. Waited a day too long to return. Wast of money.
It is considerably slower than the Apple charger. The short cable length is nice but it charges at about 40% of the charger that came with my Apple watch.
Bought this watch for my wife and she loves it. The display is beautiful and it just works. Also has most of the features of my Apple Watch for a lot less
"Bought this to sleep in with my Apple Watch, but now find myself using whatever I got on for the day. If I remember to put it on, it’s pretty comfortable."
Both my wife and son have an Apple Watch and they both love them. Getting them to update can be tricky at times but other than that they are good watches.
"This works as described, protecting my Apple Watch, I did however bump it an notice that it had chip off a little bit , but it save my watch from breaking"
Fits perfectly with Fitbit Charge 3. Believe it was a one size fits all. Only wish it were a little smaller as there are a lot of extra holes in the band.
"Not a Five Star!!!\nI lose it after 2 weeks of the purchase, It did take care of not leaving any marks on my apple watch after hitting a weight on the gym"
"This is my first time using an Apple Watch, and so far no regrets, specially the heart sensor, I use it a lot to keep track of my workouts! I recommend it"
THIS APPLE MAGNETIC charging cable does what its meant to do and holds on to my Apple Watch while doing it. Also fits nicely into the Belkin travel mount.
"Good, solid band for the Apple watch; a bit clumsy to put on/take off due to the magnet at the end on one side but, otherwise very sturdy and comfortable."
I purchased this watch for a friend of mine. It was on sale and a great price! It's her first Apple Watch and she absolutely loves it. Highly recommended!
I’ve wanted an Apple Watch sooo bad and finally caught this steal ! I love my watch and all the different wristbands I can change it to ! Great product !!
The The Apple Watch our second one. My wife\u2019s screen just opened up. Had to purchase a new one. I hope this one does not open up some battery issues.
Helps me keep track of my health and I have lost a lot of weight. It\u2019s awesome and I highly recommend it. Had an Apple Watch before but perfect this.
"I highly recommend the 44mm because of the size. Love every feature about my Apple Watch, Would recommend to all future prospects looking to buy an Apple."
"This a a very good complimentary band for use with others on apple watch. I switch between 2-4 different bands, each for different occasions or functions."
"I love this watch. As it\u2019s my First Apple Watch I can\u2019t compare it to the others but this works perfect great for exercise, walks, texting, etc."
I got this for my daughter. She loves it. She didn’t want an Apple Watch because they aren’t very feminine. She is very happy with the look of this watch.
"By far the best value for the younger Apple Watch wearers. Not all the bells and whistles of the 5 or 6, but a fantastic watch - especially for the price."
"Bestbuy had a excellent sale on most the apple watch bands, for christmas it was the opportunity for me to buy several. I'm very pleased with my purchase."
"I love these, they make working from home and yard work so much more enjoyable. I pair them with my Apple Watch to listen to my podcasts without my phone."
I love this watch its very convenient for when you can\u2019t have your phone on you 24/7. This is my first apple watch ever and I wouldn\u2019t trade it!
Switched from an Apple Watch series 2 to this. This is a fantastic upgrade that I am not so worried about damaging by things knocking into it. Very happy.
This is a great product! Just plan to use the MyQ app to open and close the door. Good thing is you can do it on your Apple Watch via the MyQ app as well!
Only reason I don\u2019t use my Fitbit any more is because I upgraded to a Apple Watch but it did everything I needed it to do when it came to working out
I wasn’t sure if I would really use an Apple Watch but now that I have it I love it! Has many more options and apps than I thought and I use it every day!
Love the Apple Watch. It\u2019s great cause my phone is always in my pocket when I\u2019m working so I can just look at it instead of pulling out my phone
"I love my Apple Watch, it is easy to use. I use it for paying for things with my Wallet. Ease of use, and a lot of apps can be accessible from your wrist."
Love my Apple Watch it’s my 4th one I keep upgrading and giving the older ones to my daughters the first was the 2 and it’s still working. They are great!
"So far so good look wise it matches Apple Watch, even the battery life is very longer .. I had to charge it only at night and wore it throughout the day.."
It\u2019s the best Apple Watch I\u2019ve used so far. The always on display makes it feel more like a standard watch and the battery life is unbelievable.
I never thought I would like to have a smartwatch until I purchased this Apple Watch. keeping task of my fitness especially during the time of a pandemic.
By far the best watch ever. Light weight and accurate. Love the ACCOUNTABILITY with the Apple Watch. I do not use my phone as much and hands are free now.
I bought this as a spare charger since the Apple Watch battery needs to be charged often. This charger works great and charges the battery really quickly.
My girlfriend loves Apple watches so I upgraded her from the Apple Watch Series 3 to this one and she loves it. I would definitely recommend Apple watches
Great Apple Watch Series 5 great battery life lasted me all day and at the end of the day it was an 80% If you buy this watch it’s quick fast and reliable
These glasses are great. I've noticed less eye strain and improved sleep quality (more REM as tracked via my Fitbit Charge 2). Would definitely recommend!
"My favorite part of the Apple Watch is getting my texts without pulling out my phone. This is perfect for work, because we are not to have our phones out."
This is a great device. I use it everyday. The battery life is amazing. Better than the Apple Watch. You can store music which is a great feature to have.
"As advertised, the Apple Watch delivers all the functionality I needed. Glad I didn't pay more for the next model up because the SE has everything I need."
"Best smart watch out there, I’ve been using Apple Watch for a while now and just upgraded to series 7. The bigger screen is and rounded edges are awesome."
Nice watch with lots of features. Definitely recommend this product. Battery life is really good when compared to Apple Watch. Charge remain for 3-4 days.
"Band is strong, nicely encloses the Fitbit charge. Fitbit fasteners didn’t last over 5 months. Found this on Amazon it was as expected and was overjoyed!."
The watch looks great and performs well. I charged the watch 2 days ago and still have battery life. The basic functions are comparable to my Apple watch.
This is worn daily with my Fitbit Ionic. I don't have any issues with it and it has held up a lot better than any of my other watch bands for this device.
The charging cable for the Fitbit versa two that I bought works very well and the price was good. I would buy it again and I would recommend it to others.
This is my third Apple Watch and will not be my last. I have never had any issues with this watch and look forward to using this one for as long as I can.
"It looks very similar to Apple Watch and can be used to view and send messages. Although the performance is very different, the price is too cheap for me."
I can\u2019t live without my Apple Watch even with a WHOOP tracker. Love being connected with my apps on the go or when I don\u2019t have my phone with me
This is the second time we purchased this Apple Watch case. Hubby liked it so much we bought it again after two years when part of the band finally split.
This is a great watch and is at a great price for all of the great features you get with an Apple Watch. Highly recommend buying this watch from Best Buy.
Received this as a Father's Day gift! This was the perfect compact device to charge both my phone and Apple Watch. Fast charging and works with no issues.
Versa lite is great. Has tons of features to help stay healthy. Very similar to Apple Watch at a third of the price. The sleep monitor is a great feature.
"It’s a gift for my husband,it’s look so fashion.its very comfortable wear. I’m so happy have this in this cost,you know it’s very similar with Apple watch"
My partner has been wanting an Apple Watch and it’s everything he expected it to be. He loves it. Only thing he can’t do with it is keep his Fitbit group.
"I love this Apple Watch. I replaced my apple 4th Generation with this. So much faster, better phone calls, speakers are great. Definitely worth the money."
"The health app is fantastic. I wouldn\u2019t say the Apple Watch is any better or worse than the Galaxy Active watches. I\u2019ve used both, I enjoy both."
I wear this all the time with my Fitbit Charge 2 and it makes it look classy and fun. Very comfortable and easy to take out links to make it fit my wrist.
I liked the computer because it\u2019s simple and quick. It doesn\u2019t take long to do anything and being able to unlock it with my Apple Watch is good.
"Our daughter was excited about her new Apple Watch!! She\u2019s 11 yrs old and is now into reaching her Move, Exercise, and Stand goals. Win, win for us!!"
Other than being a bit long I have no complaints about how well this UBS3 compatible charger works. My new Apple Watch Series 7 charges VERY fast with it.
Great smart watch. Second Apple Watch I’ve owned. Love the features and the ease to view notifications. Only concern is scratching or cracking the screen.
Love my Apple Watch. Only disadvantage is I had it for a couple years and now the battery doesn\u2019t last long before it has to be charged by lunchtime.
It definitely is a big upgrade from my apple watch series 3 and has a lot of cool new features that my series 3 didn't have and it has better battery life
Apple Watch sets the bar for fitness and style. I never leave home without it. I got it to motivate me to be more active and so far it has been a godsend.
I love my Apple Watch. My fiancé got me this upgrade fir my birthday then got her one. We both had series 3 and figured it was time to upgrade. I love it!
"Exactly what I wanted and needed. Great product and great quality. Was always afraid to hurt my Apple watch, this was a great replacement for my lifestyle"
"My daughter needed a watch, i have used Apple Watch for some years and love it. My daughter was surprised and ver happy with the watch. Makes a PaPa smile"
I love how long it holds a charge! 7 days vs 1 with Apple Watch. Dislike; I would like a dress band ! Apple Watch and Fitbit 3 have very nice dress bands.
I gave this apple watch band and to my husband as he wanted something more \u201cairy\u201d to wear when working outside in the garden. He likes it a lot.
Love my new Fitbit Charge 4. My Charge 3 suddenly stopped working and no matter what I did it wouldn’t work. Glad I bought the Charge 4. I really like it.
Has all the features one would expect from a smart phone. May not be at the level of apple watch but if you have an Android it is one of the best choices.
Wife got an Apple Watch and to no one’s surprise it did not come with a charging adapter. This works perfectly but it’s a damn shame that I had to buy it.
Small size fitbit charge 2 bands. Have only had short time but working well so far & looks nice. Holes allow easy adjustment in fit. Easy to change bands.
My girlfriend loves her new Apple Watch. We replaced her Series 2 with the Series 6. We love the always on display feature that the series 2 did not have.
I used the original apple watch cable and it wouldn't charge properly with this stand. The thickness of the ring doesn't allow the watch to charge properly
This Apple Watch would not stay charged at all had to charge it about 3 to 5 times a day and had it to Apple store twice was defective right out of the box
"I’ve had Zagg put on several screens and loved the way it protected screens, but doesn’t fit Apple Watch 7. Lifted on edges after a professional put it on."
"once again my fitbit inspire HR lasted lest than 6 months, the battery which used to last all week now goes about 12 hours rendering it pretty much useless"
I’ll e my Apple Watch this is my second one love apple the series 3 is the one I like I also had 1 seris 1 so I had a yotss Ass l of 3 watches ther Re geeT
I love my Apple Watch. My only complaint is the battery doesn\u2019t last all day especially if you have apps open. Otherwise I would definitely recommend.
Shipped me an Apple Watch with no packing paper. Unbelievable. Will be suprised if there is no damage. Good job Amazon. Update Watch works fine thankfully.
The Always On Face feature is the real game changer with this watch. I find that I actually use it more than the previous version of the Apple Watch I had.
Pretty good quality. Easy to clean with mild soap and water or Windex. Fits on Apple Watch perfectly. Happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone.
It’s very nice design well made. Looks very good with Apple Watch. The magnet is very strong it will not fall off. Kind of expensive but very good quality.
This is good to have to protect that Apple Watch of yours. It was hard to get on in the beginning but got easier once I had to take it off due to cleaning.
I have someone with an apple watch visiting me. If I were trying to figure all this out on my own with no manual to reference I would not be able to do it.
"If your wife has an Apple Watch and you travel, it won't take long to loose the charger. This little replacement is affordable and it works. Any questions?"
Nice for the price. Bought this for my wife. She has since upgraded to a Apple watch. This Versa 2 was handed down to a daughter. She loves it. Works well.
"It applies easily, but when it gets caught on something the plastic almost stretches. However, it has been able to cover and protect my apple watch nicely."
This works just fine for charging my Apple watch. My only disappointment is I had to purchase this separately. It should have been included with the watch.
"Perfect addition to Fitbit sense and easy tracking, very impressed with Fitbit over Apple Watch and Samsung active and this ecosystem is part of the reason"
We bought 2 of these. Love them. Great lighting. Love the usb - can charge my phone and Apple Watch together on my night stand. No complaints. Nicely built
The Apple Watch Series 3 has met every need that I have. It's fitness options help me target my exercise along with alerting me of my incoming phone calls.
The Apple Watch is a must especially if you work long hours and can use your phone you are able to text and call through your watch and soother cool things
This is the third Apple Watch I’ve owned and this is by far the best version I’ve owned yet. It’s slim and fits me well and isn’t big and bulky whatsoever.
"Since this is my first time purchasing an Apple Watch, I did not know what to expect. This thing is so great, I don't know why I haven't bought one sooner."
This was a replacement for my Fitbit Charge 3. Best Buy had a replacement available eliminating the need to order online and pay additional shipping costs.
I’ve only been using this for one day but so far have no complaints. I love that it doesn’t feel bulky on my wrist like some of the Apple Watch bands feel.
Great watch. Had a Fitbit and wanted something else. My Apple Watch has more features and hopefully will last longer than all the fitbit watches I’ve owned
I love this watch. I changed from a Fitbit Ionic because of too many problems and more expensive. But this one worked out just a good. Samsung all the way.
Great value! I love the color of the Apple watch band I purchased from Best Buy! It was less expensive than the one at the Apple Store. Way to go Best Buy!
Upgraded from Apple Watch 3. Definitely like the bigger watch face and always on feature. Seems to have better dictation than the 3. Overall great product.
This is my daughter’s upgrade from her previous Apple Watch. Does not disappoint. Especially that this is waterproof. Pricey for me but functional for her!
The Apple Watch series 6 is amazing. Super fast bright crisp and clear. The oxygen sensor works great. This was super easy to set up and use great product.
Apple products never ever disappoint! This is my second Apple watch and I am very impressed. The process of purchasing through Best Buy was quick and easy.
Love my Apple Watch! I get all my notifications I would on my phone and can return messages back right from the watch. It\u2019s not bulky and looks great.
Perfect fit easy Install very durable comparable to other brands but more affordable. Glad I made this purchase will recommend to other Apple Watch wearers
"This is my 4th sport loop for apple watch I own and it's definitely my favorite style. Lightweight, comfortable, sweat-proof, adjustable for a perfect fit."
I was surprised at how much I actually interact with my Apple watch all day long. I returned this to upgrade to Series 6 because it's worth the investment.
"Finally purchased my first Apple Watch. Works great. I use it in so many ways, especially tracking my walks around the neighborhood. I have it on everyday."
