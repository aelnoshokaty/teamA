9,10,review,This is my third Fitbit and this is the worst one ever. The Fitbit flex and the Fitbit Alta were amazing. The inspire 2. constantly goes into do not disturb mode it goes into water lock mode and it constantly drops notification alerts I’ve tried numerous times to reset it. I will never get another Fitbit again ever I don’t recommend it. It has been one of the most frustrating things I have ever purchased. It’s time to move to an Apple Watch I guess. What a waste of money,1
115,116,review,"Edit 4/25/2021: On 4/24 I went walking with some friends; we walked approximately 1.5 miles. We wrote down what our starting tracker numbers were. At the end of the walk everyone else's trackers tracked between 2259 and 2296 steps. My Amazfit had tracked a whooping 102 steps. On the ride in the car back to the house, my Amazfit tracked me as taking 59 steps. :-( Needless to say, the Amazfit is going back. I have ordered a Fitbit Charge 4, as having only Fitbit trackers, I know they are reliable. I will be sticking to Fitbit trackers in the future. *************************** Was super excited to order and get this tracker. It came when it was supposed to. I took it out of the package and charged it fully. I put it on last Wednesday evening before going to bed. The first thing I noticed about it on Thursday evening was that my steps were very low, so low that on Friday morning I put on the tracker that I had been wearing to compare. I also turned on the steps app on my phone. I have done all three devices over the weekend and all day today, Monday, and this tracker, at the end of every day, has been more than 3500 steps different than the other two. I know that all trackers are different and will not measure the same, but more than 3500 steps different is not acceptable. I really like the sleep tracker. It gives a lot of useful information. Compared to my old tracker, the times are within 5 minutes of each other, so that seems okay. Battery life is a joke. They say two weeks battery life; my died after not quite 5 days (Wednesday evening @ about 7:00 to Monday afternoon at about 3:00 until it was completely dead. Apparently, if you turn on any of the features that it has, heart rate monitoring, it substantially reduces the battery life. The only extra thing I turned on was the heart rate monitoring. I do not play music, hook up or use it as a phone, or any of the many other things you can do with it. I only used it as a step tracker, sleep monitor, and heart rate monitor. (After a second 5 days passed, once again, I had to recharge it as it was at 3%). I could live with the short battery life if the step tracker was even remotely correct, but more than 3500 steps off every day is not acceptable to me. Super disappointed because there are a lot of nice features about this tracker. One of my collogues also bought one of these: She is how I found out about the tracker in the first place. She has found that, like mine, her's is also completely off in the step tracking. She too spent several days with two trackers attached to her arm. We are both very disappointed. Back to the name brand trackers.",1
364,365,review,"this was my second fitbit purchase after my original versa broke. before it broke, i did enjoy using it so i opted for the versa 2. with the original versa, i would take it in the water, etc. because there was a feature for swim tracking so i thought it was waterproof. but it stopped working when i was in the water - so versa 2 i was extra careful to not let it anywhere near water. now it hasn't even been a full 6 months since purchase and it has stopped working. i was charging it during my shower and after i came out of the shower and checked, all my data for the day was gone when in the morning, it was working fine. so i proceeded to restart the versa hoping that would help. but instead, the screen would never turn back on. i called fitbit customer service and they told me to do stuff like wipe the versa, wipe the charger, restart (mind you i did all these things before i called) and it just seemed like a waste of time. honestly, this is kind of ridiculous for a watch i paid $150 for. i'm thinking of switching to apple watch instead since this is the second time this has happened. realize i could've just gotten a nice, functioning apple watch for the price of 2 fitbit versas that broke lol.",1
415,416,review,"I was so excited about this device, and I’ve been an early adopter since Oct. I’m moderately active and have used Fitbit for my regular wellness tracking and Apple Watch for my workouts. I like the Fitbit app, the data and analytics available to users and the variety of devices in their line up - however I’ve found the devices themselves to be fragile and prone to needing replacement constantly. And their customer service is nonexistent My Apple watch is great for workout tracking but is too clunky to wear 24/7 for other wellness tracking, and isn’t ideal for things like steps, overall calories burned, etc So I was THRILLED to have another option, and I’m a long time Amazon device devotee. The app is a good start, I love the idea of a lineup of prescriptive wellness labs for everything from workouts to calming exercises and binaural beats. However, the data accuracy of this device renders everything else about it COMPLETELY unusable. It’s all over the place with readings on every data category. I could have a full blown meltdown screaming match one day and be totally silent the next, my tone would register the same. I could sleep like a baby for 8hrs uninterrupted according to Fitbit one night and halo would register 8 sedentary hours and dock my activity score. The activity score is an attempt at something more dynamic than steps but the sedentary hour subtractions are frustrating (even when they’re right) and demotivating - it’s not ‘standing hours’ like you might think - the device tracks EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY that you are sitting, and combines them for a total sedentary time. Work 8 hours but get up every hour at the :30 for a 10 min walk? You might call that 8 moving hours, halo calls it 6hrs40m sedentary. Better not sit again all day or you’ll lose points And worst of all, the workout tracking- I run 1hr50min 5 days/wk for years. I’m extremely consistent, it’s almost the same run every single day. But don’t tell halo that - my 12.5miles my Apple Watch is tracking? The same workout on the same wrist, halo says I logged 2,000ish steps. Barely 1 mile",1
1073,1074,review,"A few months ago, I started following a 5k to marathon program, so my wife got me this for my Birthday in order to track my runs. It worked well enough for a few weeks (about 95% accuracy when compared to mapping my run online). After about a month, I noticed my runs getting less and less accurate to the point that it is completely useless for that activity. It will only register running paces between 8:30-9:00 minutes/mile. Once I was running 10+ miles, it would be about 2.5 miles off after each run when compared to online run mapping or my running app on my phone. The odd thing is that this fitbit versa 2 uses the GPS in my phone, so I’m not sure why it is so wildly different than my phone’s running app. I went back to my old Garmin which has its own dedicated GPS. Other points: - love the battery life (lasts 5-6 days) - decent as a sleep tracker - app is useful",1

1241,1242,review,very unhappy with the battery life and clock face that keeps changing to the wrong date. i have called fitbit twice and although they are very nice on the phone they did not solve my issues. sent me a link to read about how to deal with the battery on line. had an earlier fitbit which i loved but am very very unhappy with the Versa 2. read carefully before making the purchase - get an apple watch!,1
1388,1389,review,"So first, the good. The screen is beautiful, especially given the tiny size, and setup was extremely simple. But that already brings us to the bad. Setup was simple, but pairing it to my phone was not. This is when I first learned that Wyze is beta-testing this unfinished product. Trying to search for help with my issue was fruitless, turning up a couple of forum threads where Wyze employees merely echoed the quuck start guide. I was able to figure out what they apparently didn't know, and get connected, and immediately ran into more disappointment. First was the watch face. It is clearly set up for 24-hour format, to the point where all times are shown in ""00:00"" format (with leading zero) regardless of AM or PM. So for example, 3AM and 3PM both read as 03:00, and there is no means of switching to 24-hour format. I would just write this off as me being nitpicky, but when you look at the clock in settings in the app IT SHOWS 24-HOUR FORMAT! I was tempted to return based on this alone, as it was a clear indicator of the poor quality of the software, but I decided to keep poking around, and that's when I noticed the weather. I don't know where they get their weather data, because I've never seen a provider that was so consistently wrong. It indicated 69F(20C) despite FIVE other weather providers indicating 68-70F. I'm used to some variance, but 6F is just too much, and even the forecasts were significantly lower than the forecasts of the other weather providers I used for comparison (Dark Sky, AccuWeather, etc.). I've heard folks have trouble with basically every other function of the device, and after just an hour with the band I now believe every word. There's a ton of potential here, and the screen is GORGEOUS, but at present the Wyze Band is not worth its (very, very low) price. Also, I feel like it's too tall, but that's just a matter of taste.",1
1426,1427,review,"My FitBit Charge 2 ¨died¨ last month. It had made me happy in every way for the four years it lasted. Great product which has kept me and my doctors very happy and up to date on my fitness! Decided to purchase the newest Charge 4 , last month., on the 25 June. Two days later days later the battery completely emptied out. Checked all the instructions, updates, stats and reset options, but no real reason. FYI- battery should last about 4 days, as I do not use any peripheral apps or gadgets. Since that time the battery has been zapped three times after 24 hours. last week Called Customer service, and the (very Professional, very empathetic) agent thoroughly checked all options and troubleshooting tricks, until he confirmed that the reset button was flawed. He sent me a return label immediately. I have returned the product, and am waiting for my new, FitBit Charge 4 replacement! Don't get me wrong! I AM A FITBIT fan! Hope that this replacement will function as excellently as my first one, for the next 4 years at least! Update OK ...This is 5 days after returning the product via USPS: No feed back or ack from FitBit about receiving it. I was informed that they will send me a new replacement only after they receive the flawed one. Crossing fingers... To be continued... Latest UPDATE: 02 Aug, 2020...Very frustrated and disappointed! This is continuation of an exchange process that apparently has gone awry. I did receive a reply six days after my previous comments, in which I was informed that ""yes"" the product tracking showed it was at the last stage before arriving at the FitBit return facility. To add to the confusion FitBit emailed me a USPS return label, but in their response to my query sent me a tracking link by FEDEX.. As hope ebbs on the replacement action , and the fact that I was depending on that FITBIT4 to monitor my daily pro health activities, today, after more than eight days of the stalled tracking, I have emailed FitBit the following: Hello, once again... Please advise what is happening to my return package, sent back via your direct USPS Return Label sent to me back on the 21 or 22 July... I am more than anxious at this point about my ever receiving the exchanged FitBit 4 that was agreed to and promised. Your Customer Service has the record of the report set up by that office after verifying extensively that this FitBit 4 product was flawed and had a defect in the reset button, etc. At this point I want to reconfirm that you have finally received the product in question, so you can send me a properly working one as soon as is feasible. If this is too complicated or problematic for you, I suggest the alternate solution refund my credit card for the purchased amount. Truly, I have never had such a delay and problems with any exchanges or returns with direct vendors, much less Amazon ones. Usually once the Postal service or courier reconfirms that they have processed the return label code, the vendor immediately initiates the mailing of the replacement product, or simply refunds the customer. I have reverified all delivery tracking this morning, like every morning since I sent the FitBit4 back, but since the 25 or 26 July the tracking information seems to stop at the last stage in California. I can send you a screen shot if you have no way of seeing the information I just wrote about. I am kindly requesting that you respond with a solution ASAP: Thank you. It is 10:59 am CST 02 Aug, 2020",1
1497,1498,review,"I was very excited to get my Fitbit charge 4 yesterday. Got it set up, wore it all evening, all night, all day today. It was GREAT! I'm returning it for a full refund... it does not allow me to respond to gmail or to texts (because it does not support Textra). It is WAYYY more frustrating to get text notifications on my watch, then have to pick up my phone to respond.... same with gmail. There is NO REPLY option. Only delete, clear, or open. clicking open takes me back to the clockface. FRUSTRATING. I'd rather NOT have this than to have to live with this frustraction every day. I NEED textra so when clients text me at 10pm I can program my response to go to them at 8:01 am. Sorely disappointed. What a complete oversight this is for fitbit not to foresee this with avid android users who do not use stock apps.",1
1539,1540,review,"Update: Now my Fitbit Charge 5 has problems syncing. Tech support is basically ""restart it"", which I had to do with both the watch and the app to get it to sync this morning before calling support. It shows I got less than 3 hours sleep last night even though I was is bed from 10:30pm to 8am. I thought I was sleeping!! I'm wearing it correctly and I sync it before going to bed. This watch is pretty much worthless to me. This watch is horrible for sleep tracking. You need to have at least 3 hours of continuous sleep for it to track, so if you get up to go to the bathroom, it won't track. Also, the pedometer isn't very accurate. I can get all my steps winding yarn. Most of the important features have an extra monthly fee. That sucks. I don't use it much for workouts. It's nice and bright to read. I had a Garmin Vivosmart 4 previously and liked it much better for health monitoring. It would vibrate when my heart raced and I needed to calm down. It tracked sleep great. No extra fees. But the band was permanently attached to the watch and it broke.",1
1629,1630,review,"-edited- The device itself is plagued by software issues . The included wristband gives me horrible rash with blistering after wearing it for a week. Whoever decided to go for that material need to get a lesson in dermatology ! Also : make longer bands for those of us with larger wrists : the band is not long enough. Even in the last hole the damn thing is tight. So the suggestion to wear it 'loose' doesn't work for me ! i have no problem with any watch including the apple watch on that hand. Just this thing. bad design ! The software issues are very annoying. after weeks of wearing it the things still says 'acquiring baseline'. and 'wear the device three days in a row'. It's been weeks... spo2 monitoring doesn't work, body temp doesnt work. Another problem : time sync issues crash the EKG application. I left Chicago on a plane. The fitbit lost time sync with my phone. The result : the EKG kept throwing an error and asked to restart. I could not get the watch to resync time with the phone. Some non-obvious setting allows you to turn automatic time zone adjustment off. They suggested turning sync off and back on. Then the clock adjusted itself and the EKG worked again. That is just sloppy code. When i needed the EKG most (i had an afib episode in flight and wanted to record it) it didn't work. Half baked device. I bought an apple watch 7. that just works.",1
1665,1666,review,"Extremely frustrated. This watch is not registering my sleep, my heart rate, or my steps on a consistent basis. For instance, I had spent all day cleaning on Friday, however it said I had only walked 71 steps. And as someone recovering from COVID, I’ve been relying a lot on the HR monitor, which will often only display a line, where my HR should read. Finally, I fell asleep last night at 10:30 pm, and my watch didn’t start calculating it until 2:30am, and some nights are not being calculated at all. I am beyond irritated, as this was $140 and is not even working as well as my old Fitbit charge! Also, it is out of 30 day window so I am unable to exchange through Amazon!😠😡🤬",1

1973,1974,review,"today I went for the longest bike ride I have done in a very long time. I left at 5:56AM and finished at 9:04. Unfortunately, the Versa 3 dutifully logged this as 1 hour an 46 minutes. The ride was about 35 miles, but the Versa said it was something like 13. I chatted with Fitbit support and they said the auto-recognize feature somehow auto recognized a bike ride in the middle of my bike ride, so the watch lost a lot of data. It does not really make sense to me because there is no record of the auto-recognize event. In any case, I've turned that 'feature' off now, but I'm really kicking myself for not spending a few more dollars on the Apple watch. Every time I call fitbit support to complain that the device simply doesn't work, they ask me to update the SW. Problems keep happening. See the attached picture. Yes, I biked today from 12:00 to 2:20P, but I did not bike from san Jose to San Antonio TX in that time and if i had, it would have been more than 5.48 miles. Complete junk.",1

1999,2000,review,"I have noticed that I have to charge this fitbit Versa 2 very often, so I noted in my daytimer when I charged it to keep track. I charged on Thursday evening, wore the watch Friday to the gym. Today Sunday morning at 7:45AM I get notice, that the battery is low. What? I had a fitbit One for over 12 years, there was no charging problem. It finally gave up. Guess they don't make products to last anymore. I mainly want it for sleep tracking, it didn't track consistently either. I'm returning it.",1
2020,2021,review,"First off, this is arch was advertised in excellent condition, which to me, means like new condition. This was FAR from that. There were scratches along the edges, which weren’t terrible for a watch that would have been classified as “good” condition. That was not the deal breaker though. The battery only lasted from 7am when I took it off the charger, until about 5:15pm. Now, I’m no Apple Watch know-it-all, but my series 2 battery, which has never been replaced, lasts way longer than that!!! I’ve sent it back. Hopefully, I get a quick refund to make a new purchase soon. Very disappointing… when it says excellent condition, I expect nothing less.",1

2310,2311,review,"I used to have a Fitbit Versa I loved it so much. It worked for years, stayed charged for 2 days. Sadly it pasted away, so I thought I might as well upgrade, for about a month I read review, and details, and what this Fitbit offered that the other didn’t. I did a ton of research, this was supposed to be the best. Where do I start… CHARGE TIME: Sometimes they seem way quicker than others. LENGTH OF CHARGE HELD: Max 18 hours and 16 minutes. Somedays however, I’m lucky to get through half a day without having to recharge. Let me make this clear; I have it set on the dimmest screen setting, I have it set to only come on manually ONLY, I am NOT using GPS because I heard that was why my battery was running down so quickly, I don’t have anything running in the background to my knowledge, and I have checked and rechecked that. CLOCK FACE: There are tons of them right… with this watch do NOT expect to used 98% of them because you’ll constantly get a ❌ uninstall the app, reinstall the app, uninstall the watch from your app, reinstall the watch to your app. Try that. That don’t work, turn off your watch, uninstall your watch from your app, uninstall the app, wait 5-10 minutes, reinstall the app, turn on your watch, reinstall your watch… we’ll after doing that about 2-4 times that may finally work. (Yes as you can tell I have called customer support my share of times in these few months). NOTIFICATION: The calls and notifications you are supposed to receive in your watch, those will be you wake up alarm that will scare you to death while your sleeping after a long day at work, trying to rest up and be ready for your day of work when the sun comes up. That’s what I’m doing up at 1:30 in the morning NOW on this Wednesday morning writing a review instead of sleeping. Watch now in the kitchen and I’m going back to bed. I’d advise an Apple Watch for Apple users, and an anything besides this for everyone else. I am thinking of looking into an Apple Watch on my lunch break. Sweet dreams everyone.",1
2449,2450,review,"You have to sync the watch daily for it to keep accurate time. If you fail to sync it daily, it will be off by 10 minutes.

Only upside from the Apple Watch is that it doesn't cut off my music when I'm working out and the timer ends. I like the sleep function, seems pretty accurate.

2516,2517,review,"Let me start by saying I had no intention of switching from my Charge 4 except that the Charge 4 decided to no longer sync with my phone. After many hours with FB support, turns out they don't support ""newer"" phones, see my review of the Charge 4 if you are thinking about it. So I was stuck with needing to either downgrade my phone or change ecosystems. I did a LOT of research and decided to take a chance on Amazfit who is newer in the space. I managed to get an old Charge 3 I had to work again so I did a 5 day side by side trial. I wholly believe in a Test and Learn philosophy so it was fun to try both and see what switching would mean. Pros of the GTS 2e: - It looks good, some people could mistake it for an Apple watch which I believe was on purpose. - I like an app that defaults to dark mode - It works with my phone - LOTS of interesting, hight stat watch faces in a variety of patterns and colors - Standard 20mm band so loads of options to customize Cons (brace yourself): - Advertised to get up to 28 days of battery life, 14 in real world use and 7 in high intensity use. I got about 48 hours with constant heart rate and blood ox tracking - Heart rate tracking WAY underperforms / under reports. I am a bit OCD on my training and do a lot of HIIT. In the image you can see the Charge 3 tracking on the left (I also wear a chest strap monitor for accuracy that matched the FB w/in a beat or 2, did I mention OCD). On the right you can see the same workout tracked by the 2e. I even launched the workout manually to give it every chance possible. - Sleep tracking is overly optimistic. Side by side again (second image) FB shows 2.5 hours of REM and 1:18 deep which is pretty consistent for past 3 years. Score (not shown) was 82, again pretty consistent. 2e shows a score of 94 and VERY different sleep stages. While it may be right and FB was wrong all along, that seems unlikely. It also does not track any time ""awake"" even if you get up and go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. - App is not intuitive. While it is nice to have some screens in dark mode, others randomly switch to light mode with no control that I have found. See difference in the images. The homescreen always puts the last thing on top and there is no way to set and change what you want to see that is important to you. While it is interesting to track ""stress"" I really don't want that pushing down other stuff I find more interesting. FB wins with the ability to move things around and even delete things you don't care about (calories) to customize your screen into the same layout every time. - Step counts are wildly inaccurate. It is Covid times and I have been walking many of the same routes for months. The 2e struggles with auto-recognition of walking as an exercise and the steps are way undercounted. Particularly if you are not moving your arms. I was walking behind my snowblower for a few hours (big snow in CHI) and the FB reported 8k steps where the 2e was only half that amount. Having done this many times as well, I will go with the FB measurement as being closer. If I keep my hands in my coat on a walk, it tends to under count by 10-20%. So where does that leave me? Well, I am returning the 2e as I managed to get my Charge 4 resurrected and connected. If/when it disconnects I plan to look at Garmin as my new ecosystem as they are well established in the space and likely have worked out more of the kinks. If you are in the market for a fitness tracker, I still prefer the Fitibit ecosystem but double check supported phones before you buy. If yours is not supported then you may be in for a world of hurt with support. 2.0 out of 5 stars Poor battery life, heart rate tracking and more By Randy on February 3, 2021 Let me start by saying I had no intention of switching from my Charge 4 except that the Charge 4 decided to no longer sync with my phone.

On the right you can see the same workout tracked by the 2e. I even launched the workout manually to give it every chance possible. - Sleep tracking is overly optimistic. Side by side again (second image) FB shows 2.5 hours of REM and 1:18 deep which is pretty consistent for past 3 years. Score (not shown) was 82, again pretty consistent. 2e shows a score of 94 and VERY different sleep stages. While it may be right and FB was wrong all along, that seems unlikely. It also does not track any time ""awake"" even if you get up and go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. - App is not intuitive. While it is nice to have some screens in dark mode, others randomly switch to light mode with no control that I have found. See difference in the images. The homescreen always puts the last thing on top and there is no way to set and change what you want to see that is important to you. While it is interesting to track ""stress"" I really don't want that pushing down other stuff I find more interesting. FB wins with the ability to move things around and even delete things you don't care about (calories) to customize your screen into the same layout every time. - Step counts are wildly inaccurate. It is Covid times and I have been walking many of the same routes for months. The 2e struggles with auto-recognition of walking as an exercise and the steps are way undercounted. Particularly if you are not moving your arms. I was walking behind my snowblower for a few hours (big snow in CHI) and the FB reported 8k steps where the 2e was only half that amount. Having done this many times as well, I will go with the FB measurement as being closer. If I keep my hands in my coat on a walk, it tends to under count by 10-20%. So where does that leave me? Well, I am returning the 2e as I managed to get my Charge 4 resurrected and connected. If/when it disconnects I plan to look at Garmin as my new ecosystem as they are well established in the space and likely have worked out more of the kinks. If you are in the market for a fitness tracker, I still prefer the Fitibit ecosystem but double check supported phones before you buy. If yours is not supported then you may be in for a world of hurt with support. Images in this review",2
2561,2562,review,"I tried the Amazon Halo for about a month, but honestly after I realized it didn't track sleep except that night everything else was lackluster. I work graveyard shift from 6:30 pm-5am. Sleep is difficult to begin with. Halo only tracks sleep between the hours of, I think, 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Halo have a monthly fee after the initial offering to see your stats. Honestly get a Fitbit or an Apple. I have a Fitbit, but wanted to try the body fat measurement the Halo claims to have. That's the same thing that can be done with a secondary app you take a picture of yourself and it gives you a guesstimate. I didn't like it, especially after I learned that it wouldn't track my sleep.",2

It’s small lightweight form factor fits in my pocket and the wired ear buds work great to keep my music pumping during my runs. There are two areas where the ear buds fall short: sweat and not being wireless. The Skullcandy Sesh Evo’s are the 4th Bluetooth device I’ve attempted to use to solve these two problems after the previous 3 failed.\r\n\r\nDuring the first run I paired the Sesh Evo’s with my iPod nano and fired up my playlist. The first thing I discovered is that not a single one of the Evo’s physical button controls functioned at all. Reaching into my pocket to control the Nano was going to be a point of frustration as I’m used to reaching to the chin control buttons on the earbuds for track skipping and volume adjustments. Frustrating but not the end of the world as most times my playlists don’t need to be changed during my runs. I began my pre-run stretch routine and the left ear bud fell out of my ear and rolled a few feet down the concrete. This is not a good start. I brushed it off, readjusted the fit and continued stretching. \r\n\r\nWith pre-warm up done, I began jogging. Within 10 feet the right ear bud fell out of my ear and rolled 3 feet down the asphalt. Not cool. I re-inserted the bud in the ear, made a few more adjustments and I’m back on the run. After another minute of running, I noticed the music was cutting in and out based on how I turned my head. I look right, I lose audio. I look down I lose music. I look up and the right ear bud falls out again. This run is not going well. \r\n\r\nThe Evo’s come with several different size rubber tips so I turned around and went back inside to try a different fitting. I found a size that felt more snug. I head back out, this time I made it 2 miles before the right ear bud fell out again and rolled almost 10 feet down the hill.\r\n\r\nAt this point I should call out that I sweat. A lot. Especially during longer runs and in several half-marathons over the years my ear pods will collect enough sweat to stop working temporarily. Water resistant ear buds are something I need. So I’m now standing on the side of the road trying to figure out if they are falling out because my ears are sweating or if it’s because I’m not inserting them properly. I imagine the people who live in the house I’m now in front of making odd jerking motions with my head were rather confused. I found that tilting my head forward or sideways results in the right bud falling out of my right ear almost every time yet the left stays in place. I resume running when I think I’ve finally found the magic position to keep these things in. Now I can focus on seeing if I can figure out why the music keeps cutting in and out. I make it about a hundred yards and the right ear bud decides to make a run for it down the hill. At this point I give up on the Evo’s, shove them in my pocket and finish my workout with no music. \r\n\r\nAfter a shower I spend a bit more time trying out the different tips and seeing how hard I can shake my head, how far I can tilt my head forward and sideways before they fall out. My girlfriend who sees me attempting this in front of the mirror is in tears laughing. I learn if I twist them in just the right way, they stay in with these forced motions. I head over to Skullycandy’s website where they have a video showing the proper way to insert them and am happy that this is what I’m doing. I have hope tomorrow’s workout will be better. \r\n\r\nThat night I paired the Evo’s to my iPad Pro. This time the use case was to watch a movie, and give FaceTime a try. The iPad is a Bluetooth 5 device which meant that all of the physical easy control buttons on the Evo will function. While the documentation says they are easy, in practice I found them uncomfortable to use. It actually hurts my ears to press the buttons, especially for controls like Volume Down where you have to press twice. Changing EQ Modes was brutal and what I ended up doing to get through it was to remove one of the ear buds and make the changes while it was out of my ear, then go through that awkward insert and twist motion to reposition it. I’m used to Over the Ear wireless headphones for this use case so my frustration is mounting. Once again I find using the device to control the experience is better than trying to use the Evo’s directly. In short, insert them, then try not to touch them. \r\n\r\nFor the Day 2 run, I decide to pair them with my Apple Series 5 Watch. I sync some music directly to my watch and go for a run. I’m pleased to find the music is playing smoothly and is not cutting in and out like the previous day confirming what I thought: Bluetooth 5 device connected to a Bluetooth 4 device is just not a good experience. While on my run I tried changing tracks and that right ear bud decided to go for a run of its own down the hill again. I’m thankful this neighborhood doesn’t have drain pipes. Back in my ear and back on the run, I try again. It hurt. In hindsight pressing buttons multiple time that are lodged in your ear is just not a good idea. I’m now holding my wrist up to use the controls on the Apple Watch to adjust volume or change the music. I’m trying to find the positive and I keep thinking to myself: look ma - no wires! I finish the workout; this time the Evo’s only fall out twice. \r\n\r\nBack home, and sitting at my desk, I connect the Evo’s back to my iPad Pro and spend a bit of time experimenting with button pressing. I never can find a way to press the button that doesn’t hurt my inner ears. I content removing one, making adjustments and putting it back in is the better method, but that’s really annoying. \r\n\r\nI’m going to give them another shot tomorrow, again paired with the Apple Watch. I did enjoy not needing the Nano in my pocket, I just need them to stay in my ears for the whole journey.",2

2830,2831,review,"I bought the Fitbit Charge 5 with the hope of tracking my sleep patterns, exercise activities, and basic some vital signs throughout the day. In using it I found the sleep tracking feature to be unreliable and inaccurate. Particularly annoying was its inability to always distinguish short wake times as part my night's sleep cycle. For example, I go to sleep at 11:30pm and wake up at 2:30am. I may or may not actually get up, but go back to sleep at 2:50am. The next morning the tracking data says I began my sleep cycle at 2:50am and completely ignores my first three hours of sleep! What's worse was that sometimes it recognized the awake time as part of a larger sleep cycle and sometimes it didn't. Explanations of how it collects data are pointless. It either has the ability to do it under real life circumstances or should it not claim that it does. I also had a problem with the blood oxygen feature display either not visible or not working. In speaking with customer support I found out that the blood oxygen feature only works during sleep cycles. There were other features that worked OK, but the sleep tracking problem was a deal breaker. I returned the device after 10 days for a full refund. Reason: Did not work as claimed.",2
3245,3246,review,"Great battery life, good step tracker, horrible for tracking sleep. Last night's report says I slept from 10:53 p.m. till 12:24 a.m. then from 1:25 a.m. till 7:41 a.m., then from 9:59 p.m. till 11:11 p.m., then from 1:38 a.m. till 8:31 a.m. Obviously totally out of whack, and it happens all the time! I usually go to bed around 10:30 and go right to sleep. Many nights my FitBit says I didn't fall asleep until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. My FitBit Versa 1 had the same problem. When the battery died and FitBit gave me an accommodation price on the Versa 2, I hoped it would work better. It doesn't. Oh, and in addition to my original FitBit Versa 1, I've had to replace two FitBit 2s because of dead batteries. Next time this one dies, it will be out of warranty. I don't think I'll go for the accommodation price for the next generation. :-(",2
3479,3480,review,"If all you need is a watch with a great band, you'll like it. As for keeping track of your sleep, it skips some nights completely, some nights it begins tracking anywhere around 2:00 am to 4:00am when I'm asleep before midnight (I'm on a Cpap machine so know I was asleep) and some nights it tracks it correctly. It doesn't keep track of your steps unless you are moving your arm so if you are pushing a cart or holding something in that arm it will not record those steps. The most frustrating of all is that it constantly disconnects from Bluetooth and I can't get it to connect without calling Fitbit for help. When I first got it I was able to check the weather, etc. when I was out but now have to check with my friend who has an apple watch which never disconnects. I would have purchased an apple watch but have an android cell phone. I see the Sense is now at a much better price which would have helped with all of the time I've spent trying to get this to work as a smart watch not a dumb one. On the plus side it does charge quickly and the battery charge does last longer than the apple watch. Also, the heart rate and SPO2 seem to be accurate.

It is now 11:45 and I've been out walking ... for at least 3 miles and pushing an hour. Back home for about 30 minutes .... still waiting to sync.

The low frequency sounds (bass) not very impressed. 4. Not enough options with the haptic clicks (Siri, choose between play,pause,next,prev,volume) 5.

4366,4367,review,"Overall the watch functioned well in measuring activities. However, the bluetooth connection distance was very limited, often failing to stay connected one room away.

4958,4959,review,"I was a big fitbit guy back in 2015/2016, but after replacing it three to four times in a single year I needed something better. I've been using an Apple Watch for some time now and it is very ""meh"" in the fitness department and I won't wear something that bulky to track sleep. Wife got me the halo thinking it would be a nice surprise X-mas gift (she's great!). Wore it for about four months and unfortunately had to give it up. First, it's just flat out uncomfortable. There was some skin irritation but it did not last long. During the day, I was constantly adjusting it; I could feel every bit of the hard plastic through the band. At night it would drive me crazy and sometimes keep me up, so there were nights where I would not wear it at all. For the activity measurement part, it seemed ""ok"". Point tracking system is easy, and the sedentary hours did motivate me to get off my butt sometimes. Sleep measurement was mind boggling. I am a chronic insomniac; I have a hard time falling asleep, and I typically wake up almost every night around the same time but do eventually go back to sleep. This device would say, every night, I fell asleep in less than 10 minutes....even though I was still awake. Apparently if I am just stationary for a while, say, reading a book, my heart rate drops (I have a low resting heart rate) and I'm apparently asleep, at least according to the device. To make matters worse, when I would wake up at 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning, get out of bed, and sit on the couch and read for a bit, the device would not even register it. I usually am back in bed within an hour or so, then get up at 5:30 to start my day. The device, though, would tell me I had no interruptions. Really? You can't detect when someone is literally getting out of bed? Or in bed, awake, reading a book? Voice recognition...this is not something that I knew anyone needed. This did seem pretty accurate. People often tell me I sound a certain way, and this device confirmed it. That being said, it absolutely devours battery life; better left off, I say. I'm sure the device is great for some folks, but not for me. The body mass aspect seems great, and people could probably relax a bit; nobody is sending naked ""pictures"" of you anywhere. I did not pay any attention to any of the multitude of fitness programs the app kept tossing at me (almost like advertisements.....hmmm) so I can't comment on that. If you want a device that tracks your steps (and does so generously, as it seems to always 10-15% more than I actually did), I say go for it. For the sleep aspect, look at another device. Also would not pay $100 for this, not in its current state. Needs an update/new version.",3

If you are tracking your workout you can't go back to the home screen, or any other screen, to use other features like timer or just see the time on the watch face.\n\nIf you want to save some money its not a bad idea, but the apple watch I had beforehand made a lot more sense for tracking my training sessions.",3
5242,5243,review,"I just switched from the Sense to the Garmin Lily and thought I’d share my comparison between the two. Things the Sense does better: - Both have a silent vibrating alarm. The Sense’s snooze is 9 minutes, which seems weird to me but whatever. The Lily’s is 10. What the Sense does better, though, is that it updates the time on your wrist when it goes off again after being snoozed. So if your alarm goes off at 6 am, and you hit snooze, when it goes off again the watch reads 6:09. I appreciate the running update on how long I’ve been snoozing for. On the Lily, it shows the original alarm time, every time. So if I hit snooze 3 times it will still say “6:00 alarm” when it goes off, even though it’s really 6:30. - Because the screen is bigger, you can read more of the content of your text message notifications than you can on the Lily. Also, because the Lily’s screen is smaller, sometimes the notifications get partially covered up by the options to clear or respond to them. So notifications on the Sense are easier to read. - The Sense syncs with your phone’s silent and Do Not Disturb settings, which I appreciate. If your phone isn’t vibrating or making noise, the Sense won’t vibrate either. With the Lily, you have to set the watch to be on Do Not Disturb separately, or it still vibrates when your phone gets notifications. - The Lily’s vibration is LOUD. It’s pretty noticeable in a quiet room, so if your phone is blowing up and you’re in a meeting it’s a little awkward. I’m also not sure how good the actual vibration sensation on the Lily is… Sometimes I feel like I hear it going off more than I feel it. The Sense seemed much quieter and more subtle, and I felt it rather than heard it. - You can respond to texts/calls on the Sense. You can actually talk to someone who calls you using the Sense, and you can use voice-to-text to send a tailored text message response. The Lily only offers stock responses. - Sleep tracking. Fitbit is well known for offering the most detailed, most accurate sleep tracking. - More features. But will you use them? Things the Lily does better: - It’s GORGEOUS. I feel like I’m wearing a piece of art on my wrist! The Sense is… fine? It looks like a nice fitness watch, but that’s all I can really say about it. - SO lightweight. I didn’t realize how heavy the Sense was until I put on the Lily. That being said, since I didn’t notice the Sense being heavy until I switched, it obviously didn’t bother me much. - The Lily is much smaller. Check out the side-by-side comparison pictures. Enough said. I have a tiny wrist, and Fitbits have always looked and felt bulky on me. The Lily fits me better in every way. - Garmin has an excellent app that provides very detailed information at no extra cost to the user, unlike Fitbit, where you need the $10 per month subscription to access all of the features. Which you do actually need in order to benefit from some of the Sense’s advertised options, like stress tracking. You can’t see details about your stress rating without Fitbit Premium. If you add $10 per month, the Sense becomes an even more expensive watch than its already high list price. - Garmin’s tracking results are a lot more extensive, in pretty much every domain they track. I think it’s cool how much data I can see. Not everyone might want to have that much information, but I think it’s great. IMO, it blows Fitbit’s app away. For example, you can track specific movements with Garmin (like you can tell it you were doing deadlifts or sit-ups or leg raises, and how many reps you did of each – the list of options is huge. It will even auto-populate what muscle groups you worked in strength training. At one point, the exercise recognition feature figured out I was doing push-ups and jumping jacks without me telling it, which was neat! - It’s a lot cheaper and does most things you need in a smart fitness watch. Ultimately, for me, choosing between the Sense and the Lily came down to the fact that 1) the Lily looks way prettier and more professional and 2) I rarely use all of the advanced health features the Sense offers. I only really need text/call notifications, a morning alarm, and fitness tracking. Why pay $100+ more for features I don’t even use? My advice would be that if you’re thinking about spending the money on the Sense, think about whether you’ll even use all of the special features it offers. Personally, I’m glad I made the switch. There’s nothing wrong with the Sense, but as always, it comes down to what’s important and what features you’ll actually benefit from, whether those features involve looks or function. 4.0 out of 5 stars Comparison: Fitbit Sense vs. Garmin Lily By H Clark on May 24, 2021 I just switched from the Sense to the Garmin Lily and thought I’d share my comparison between the two. Things the Sense does better: - Both have a silent vibrating alarm. The Sense’s snooze is 9 minutes, which seems weird to me but whatever. The Lily’s is 10. What the Sense does better, though, is that it updates the time on your wrist when it goes off again after being snoozed. So if your alarm goes off at 6 am, and you hit snooze, when it goes off again the watch reads 6:09. I appreciate the running update on how long I’ve been snoozing for. On the Lily, it shows the original alarm time, every time. So if I hit snooze 3 times it will still say “6:00 alarm” when it goes off, even though it’s really 6:30. - Because the screen is bigger, you can read more of the content of your text message notifications than you can on the Lily. Also, because the Lily’s screen is smaller, sometimes the notifications get partially covered up by the options to clear or respond to them. So notifications on the Sense are easier to read. - The Sense syncs with your phone’s silent and Do Not Disturb settings, which I appreciate. If your phone isn’t vibrating or making noise, the Sense won’t vibrate either. With the Lily, you have to set the watch to be on Do Not Disturb separately, or it still vibrates when your phone gets notifications. - The Lily’s vibration is LOUD. It’s pretty noticeable in a quiet room, so if your phone is blowing up and you’re in a meeting it’s a little awkward. I’m also not sure how good the actual vibration sensation on the Lily is… Sometimes I feel like I hear it going off more than I feel it. The Sense seemed much quieter and more subtle, and I felt it rather than heard it. - You can respond to texts/calls on the Sense. You can actually talk to someone who calls you using the Sense, and you can use voice-to-text to send a tailored text message response. The Lily only offers stock responses. - Sleep tracking. Fitbit is well known for offering the most detailed, most accurate sleep tracking. - More features. But will you use them? Things the Lily does better: - It’s GORGEOUS. I feel like I’m wearing a piece of art on my wrist! The Sense is… fine? It looks like a nice fitness watch, but that’s all I can really say about it. - SO lightweight. I didn’t realize how heavy the Sense was until I put on the Lily. That being said, since I didn’t notice the Sense being heavy until I switched, it obviously didn’t bother me much. - The Lily is much smaller. Check out the side-by-side comparison pictures. Enough said. I have a tiny wrist, and Fitbits have always looked and felt bulky on me. The Lily fits me better in every way. - Garmin has an excellent app that provides very detailed information at no extra cost to the user, unlike Fitbit, where you need the $10 per month subscription to access all of the features. Which you do actually need in order to benefit from some of the Sense’s advertised options, like stress tracking. You can’t see details about your stress rating without Fitbit Premium. If you add $10 per month, the Sense becomes an even more expensive watch than its already high list price. - Garmin’s tracking results are a lot more extensive, in pretty much every domain they track. I think it’s cool how much data I can see. Not everyone might want to have that much information, but I think it’s great. IMO, it blows Fitbit’s app away. For example, you can track specific movements with Garmin (like you can tell it you were doing deadlifts or sit-ups or leg raises, and how many reps you did of each – the list of options is huge. It will even auto-populate what muscle groups you worked in strength training. At one point, the exercise recognition feature figured out I was doing push-ups and jumping jacks without me telling it, which was neat! - It’s a lot cheaper and does most things you need in a smart fitness watch. Ultimately, for me, choosing between the Sense and the Lily came down to the fact that 1) the Lily looks way prettier and more professional and 2) I rarely use all of the advanced health features the Sense offers. I only really need text/call notifications, a morning alarm, and fitness tracking. Why pay $100+ more for features I don’t even use? My advice would be that if you’re thinking about spending the money on the Sense, think about whether you’ll even use all of the special features it offers. Personally, I’m glad I made the switch.

Good piece of tech for persons that want to track sleep and also for people that they don't want to use their smartphone for a walk or run cause have GPS built-in. If you want pay with a wearable that works like %98 everywhere go for a Samsung wearable, Samsung Pay works like %97 everywhere, Fitbit pay works basically like Apple pay they work most of the time at stores near Stadiums or University's or Casinos The only thing that prevent me to give this Fitbit 5 stars is the screen... hopefully the Fitbit Charge 5 should fix the sunlight problem",4
5830,5831,review,"Having sifted through the numerous reviews for the Amazon Halo, I decided to throw my opinion into the fray. The Amazon Halo is Amazon's first attempt at a wearable health tracking device and for a first attempt it's an above average product. Having worn the bad for roughly 2 months, here is my experience. Sleep 4/5: My biggest concern when applying for the beta testing was the idea of wearing something on my wrist when sleeping with concerns of it being more of an annoyance preventing me to sleep rather than being a helpful tracking device; I was wrong. That isn't to say that it's 100% unnoticeable but it since day 1 I have not had any significant issues with wearing the Halo while sleeping. I wear it a bit looser while sleeping to provide some give and the fit is 100% customizable thanks to the velcro strap. The tracking itself is average I would say, having had a few nights with nightmare issues the Halo recognized these as disturbances in my sleep and this was reflected in my overall sleep score. On a side note, seeing that you received a high score is almost like a cup of coffee in the morning. A pseudo-side effect I'm sure but mind of matter, right? I will say that the sleep tracking presents you with the most basic of information, if you are looking for in-depth analysis then the Halo is not for you. Exercise 3/5 - Like sleep, it will present you will the most basic of information such as heart BPM, step counter, total time and the intensity of the workout. The issue I see for many is that the data is not readily available on your wrist. For me, this was advantageous as I did not want another notification machine on my wrist as I have with my Apple Watch (which I wear opposite of the Halo). With a lack of in depth analysis and the user having to use a separate device (your phone) to access the data the Halo is collecting, I can understand why this would be an issue for some. I personally like the Halo not having a screen but admittedly the data available is rudimentary that most smart phone come with already. Tone 3/5 - Unfortunately, I view this as more of a gimmick than a feature to be taken serious at this stage. I was initially really excited about this feature and interested to see what ""others hear"" while I'm speaking. My problem here is that some days I have 3 ""notable moments"", other days I'm in the high 30's. The reason I see this as an issue is my days are fairly routine with the same type of interactions day in and day out. The other aspect of this is the way the data is presented. Now I understand the fear of voice recordings and privacy concerns (although let's be honest, we all have willing put microphones and cameras in our pockets and our homes) but to say I was ""curious"" at 9:10AM for 5.1 seconds gives me nothing to work of off to improve my tone. The best this feature can achieve is providing you general data on your tone for the day which has its value but once again do not look for in depth analysis. I will say it is fun to joke around how ""amused"" your tone is when you are speaking your friends when compared to how ""irritated"" your tone is when with your girlfriend! Body Scans 4/5 - This is the tough pill to swallow in all of this and something most of us probably did not have access to on a regular basis and this might very well be the crowing feature of the Halo. The Halo will ask you to take photos of your body (Amazon says they are secure and to not worry but who really knows, you are already sending nasty stuff to the person you met on Tinder so what's the difference) and based of these photos the app will calculate your Body Mass Index or BMI which is consider to be a more accurate deciphering of your health. The app will calculate your body fat percentage and based off your weight, height and age will determine if you are in a healthy range. Most of us know we can do better and the app isn't shy when it comes to the truth, its really what we do with this data that will determine how much value the Halo brings into our lives. I gave this 4/5 because I cannot compare this to what a medical professionals scan would result in but it seems accurate. All Other Aspects 4/5 - The design of the Halo itself is sleek and simple with just a single button. Other devices might give you more in depth, real time analysis but with screens and notifications they can be overwhelming. I have read some reviews where the user says the band is not secure and the metal case of the device ""slams into my wrist bone""... First off this made me laugh as the device weighs close to nothing and couldn't possible produce a slamming effect on the most sensitive of individuals but more importantly the bands are very secure and unless worn intentional loose will be fine. There are a variety of colors of bands to choose coming in both a fabric and silicon. The fabric cleans easily as we all as the silicon. I think they are a bit expensive but I would suggest purchasing a silicon strap for intense work outs as to not dirty the fabric strap. Most are currently showing a 4-6 week shipping time frame. Uncharacteristic of Amazon but with the ongoing pandemic I'm sure production and shipping deadlines were thrown out the window. The app itself has many cool features such as a myriad of labs (weekly experiments and challenges to push you to sleep or exercise more efficiently) to choose from in the discover tab. There is also a live feature where you can get real time tracking on the tone of your voice and your current BPM. The charging clip is a bit of an oddity and not as easy to use as others. The clip has to fit just write for the Halo to charge properly and there is nothing within the clip itself to line up the device with the charger. Some days you can take 30 seconds just trying to line up the device so it begins to charge. This is probably the biggest hardware issue with the Halo and is absolutely something Amazon needs to reimagine. The battery life lasts about 2 days but will drain much faster if the microphone is always active. Another aspect of the device that Amazon will have to look into if they continue to push Tone as a key feature in the 2.0 version as key features shouldn't have such a detrimental effect on the battery life. My girlfriend turned her microphone off and the device lasted for 4 days with no charge! For $100, the Amazon Halo is not a bad choice for those looking for basic health tracking information and a way to motivate you to get your steps in. The data does not provide a lot of depth and for first attempt the Halo does many things above average. It's a fun, inexpensive device that I wear and check in daily. I would recommend it if you are looking for general info or are new to the wearable device game. Could also be a good device for children to teach them the importance of health and exercise since the app is pretty straight forward and uncomplicated, the no screen feature will prevent distractions during school time. As with anything else, the value will really be how you use it and what you do with the information is provides.",4

Various Third-party apps are coming forward for Fitbit interfaces like Spotify, Uber, Starbucks etc. Its no full but have a potential consider Google's acquisition. 7. There is no speaker. Alexa can't prompt answer to your questions, instead it answers in text. 8. This one is claimed to be water-proof. 9. Some other features like the Relax app, movement reminders and step counters are all very useful. There are other exercises and work out trackers also. 10.

7177,7178,review,"just got first gps + health stat watch. i've run for decades and never had one (I have indestructible casio g shock). after one run with a friend's apple watch as a trial, I bought a venue sq. if you are active, this will immediately be seen as essential once you try it. considered apple, but decided to go garmin instead. the Venu SQ (no music) is great so far. some of the other models available seemed like they would be too large on my wrist. this is almost apple watch sized, so it's a direct alternative. i chose garmin so I can use an independent platform (strava) + the garmin network. It may ultimately prove a 5 start in a month or two - after some activities get logged, I'll see how easily that goes. I also considered forerunner 745. that watch seems better if you want more stats and run frequently. i thought it was too much for a first watch. maybe i'd upgrade in a few years to a forerunner, but for now, this is the ideal intro to this type of watch and all it can tie into for logging your workouts.",4

8335,8336,review,There's only one problem with this.... At midnight the watch says 00:00. Instead of 12:00. So if it's 12:30 at night it says 00:30. I have noticed this same problem with 3 other smart watches of different brands. I'm not sure why they have this one main glitch. The watch gets updates so im sure it can be fixed with the correct update but it just kind of annoys me. If a watch cost so much money the main thing it should get right is the time! All 3 watches I've tried for Android have this problem. The apple watch does not have this problem. I was even curious as to why noone else had mentioned this defect in any reviews I've seen on YouTube. It seems like a big thing that a watch maker should get right 1st before they start any other fansy stuff. I still like this watch and I own it. Just be aware of it's main flaw. I'm hoping they will fix it soon. As of now the time is still not correct,4
8643,8644,review,"First, I want to point out (as I stated in the title), this is NOT a smart watch, by any means. It has some similar features (i.e., the ability to receive notifications from your phone, like texts), but by no means should someone wanting all the features a smart watch offers seriously look into this item, as you will be disappointed.\n\nThat disclaimer being said, I wasn't expecting much, and was pleasantly surprised by the accuracy of the stats compared to my Apple Watch. I tested them by wearing one on each wrist when I went out for a several mile walk with my dog, and all of the stats (steps, calories, heart rate, etc) were all either identical or negligibly different (which could've been caused by the way I swung my arms or if I was holding the leash with one arm more than the other). The only issue I had with accuracy was tracking sleep. On multiple occasions, the Halo View tracked sleep much longer than I had been asleep (or even in bed) in the morning, and was up to 2 hours late in starting to track sleep, saying I had fallen asleep after 2am, yet went to bed at 11:30 and was asleep by midnight. I don't currently sleep with my Apple Watch, so I can't speak to the accuracy versus that device, but I do use the Sleep Cycle app, and when I compared the data from the Halo View to the app, there were several discrepancies beyond the start and end of sleep.\n\nFor the TL;DR crew:\nPros\n* battery life is great!\n* notifications are available on the Halo View from your phone (but you're unable to reply or really do anything with them but read them)\n* accuracy of movement data + heart rate is excellent!\n\nCons\n* somewhat difficult to put on tight enough to get a good reading, but got easier with use\n* charger can be difficult to line up with the device (or maybe I've just been spoiled by the way the Apple Watch charges) \n* issues with accuracy for sleep tracking (see above for details)\n* it might just be the way I sleep, but the home button on the Halo View (and thus the vibration from hitting the home button) was hard to get used to and I kept setting it off in my sleep",4

9065,9066,review,"I can’t say enough about how excited I am that someone finally made a smart fitness watch for people with tiny wrists! I’ve been wearing Fitbit smartwatches for years, but it’s always bugged me how bulky they look on my arm. See the side-by-side comparison picture of the Fitbit Sense and the Garmin Lily... enough said. So when it felt like time for a change, I just had to try the Lily! And I’m so glad I did. I absolutely adore it. Here’s my quick list of pros and cons after a couple of weeks of wearing it: Pros: - GORGEOUS. I can’t stop staring at the beautiful pattern on the lens. I feel like I’m wearing a piece of art on my wrist! - SO lightweight. I didn’t realize how heavy my old fitness watch (the Fitbit Sense) was until I put on the Lily! I was blown away by how light it is. - Does everything I need in a smartwatch – can wake me up in the morning with an alarm, provides notifications for texts/calls, tracks fitness activities, and more. - Garmin has an excellent app that provides very detailed information at no extra cost to the user (unlike Fitbit, where you need a monthly subscription to take advantage of all of the features that watches like the Sense offer). Garmin’s tracking results are a lot more extensive, and their fitness tracking in particular blows Fitbit away. For example, you can track specific movements with Garmin. You can tell it you were doing deadlifts or sit-ups or leg raises and how many reps you did of each – the list of options is huge. It will even auto-populate what muscle groups you worked in strength training. At one point, the exercise recognition feature figured out I was doing push-ups and jumping jacks without me telling it, which was neat! Cons: - The Lily has a silent (vibrating) alarm, and if you hit snooze it goes off again 10 minutes later. When it goes off again, it shows your original alarm time rather than the actual time (e.g., if the alarm goes off at 6 am and I hit snooze, it still shows “6 am” when it goes off again despite the actual time being 6:10). - Because the screen is small (which I love) this means that sometimes the notifications for texts get partially covered up by the options to clear or respond to them. So you kind of have to guess what some words are. - Doesn’t sync with phone Do Not Disturb or silence settings. If my phone is on DnD or silent, I have to set the watch to be on DnD/silent separately, or it will still vibrate when my phone gets notifications. - And the vibrations are LOUD. It’s pretty noticeable in a quiet room, so if your phone is blowing up and you’re in a meeting it’s a little awkward. I’m also not sure how good the actual vibration sensation is… Sometimes I feel like I hear it going off more than I feel it. So there you have it! The Fitbit Sense addresses all of these cons (updating the alarm time after snoozing, more room on the screen to read notifications, syncing with phone Do Not Disturb/silent settings, more subtle vibrations). Fitbit also does better with sleep tracking, and you can use the Fitbit Sense to talk on the phone and send tailored text message responses through voice-to-text (the Lily doesn’t have a microphone, so it can only send a few stock text responses). But despite all of that, I’m glad I switched from the Sense to the Lily. The pros are just so good -- they easily outweigh all of the cons, at least for me.

The Fitbit Sense addresses all of these cons (updating the alarm time after snoozing, more room on the screen to read notifications, syncing with phone Do Not Disturb/silent settings, more subtle vibrations). Fitbit also does better with sleep tracking, and you can use the Fitbit Sense to talk on the phone and send tailored text message responses through voice-to-text (the Lily doesn’t have a microphone, so it can only send a few stock text responses). But despite all of that, I’m glad I switched from the Sense to the Lily. The pros are just so good -- they easily outweigh all of the cons, at least for me. I’ll be sticking with Garmin’s line of smaller watches moving forward! Images in this review",5
9956,9957,review,"I was playing tennis with some friends when I fell really hard. So hard, my Apple Watch asked if I needed emergency services. lol I landed on my knee, and it took me a minute to get up. My friend brought over some Arnicare gel and told me to put it on my knee. Their grandmother swore by it, and she made believers out of them. I rubbed a small amount in, got up and sat to rest and get water. In a minute or two, the pain was gone. I even went back to playing tennis as normal! I purchased some a couple of days later when I had a different ache. This stuff is amazing!!! It has completely gotten rid of the pain on everything I’ve tried it on, except one time on my shoulder blade...I slept on it wrong. Maybe because it was deep in there, or I couldn’t reach it as well? It still worked well enough for me to go about my day. Regardless...I’m still in love for the many times it has taken the pain away completely!!! Oh, and it doesn’t leave an odor...another plus! Arnicare, where have you been all my life?! :0)",5
10106,10107,review,"My parents bought this for me as they would be visiting and my dad wanted an affordable exercise bike (win-win for me, because I get a bike to exercise on). My dad had some trouble putting it together, but once it was, here are the pros: 1. It's silent. They have a 30+ year old non electronic recumbent Schwinn and it's loud. 2. it calculates speed and time. 3. Not too heavy to move around. 4. I'm 5' 0"" and no issues reaching pedals. 5. Love the pedal straps to get better range of motion. Cons: 1. Seat is a little uncomfortable. I put my computer chair pads on it to make it more so. 2. Pulse is inaccurate. Doesn't match my Apple Watch (which is accurate-used it while strapped up in the cardiologist's office and it was In synch with the cardiologist medical grade equipment).

11014,11015,review,"Well the product itself does not give you the ability to run faster, but it makes it a whole lot easier to train. I love the watch! It will give you your heart rate constantly and tracks runs very accurately! Don’t trust the race predictors though because they are not accurate. Mine told me I could run a 5k in 18:53... my PR is 21:18. That’s just a side gig they added for advertising purposes, but it might as well not be part of the watch. I had an Apple Watch series 3 and it was very frustrating when I did workouts such as intervals or 400m reps. The touch screen on the Apple Watch is hard to use when running so I switched to a Garmin Forerunner 45. I only used that for a few days because the heart rate was bogus. It just spat out random numbers and didn’t actually mean anything. I then decided to bring my budget up and buy the 245. Greatest watch investment I’ve made! It helps with quite a few different exercises, not just running. Strength training is an option and helps keep you from taking too long rest periods. GREAT PRODUCT!! Garmin, keep doing what you do!!",5
11198,11199,review,"This is liquid GOLD! I've always been able to operate with less sleep - but I do really enjoy my sleep. My biggest problem is not falling asleep but rather staying asleep. I get up to go to the bathroom at least once a night and when I crawl back in bed, I usually scroll on my phone for 45 minutes to an hour trying to fall back asleep (yes I know its the worst thing you can do but after minutes of tossing and turning....its the only thing that keeps me in bed). As soon as I started taking this I noticed that yes I still get up to go the bathroom but I literally fall asleep as soon as I get back into bed. No need to scroll my phone and no more tossing and turning. I have always been a morning person - like I choose to wake up at 5:30 even on weekends and even if I didn't ""choose"" my internal body clock wakes me up then. Now I feel like I jump out of bed at that time. Im so ready to start my day and I have more energy throughout. My Apple Watch has even been SHOWING me that my sleep quality is better. This paired with the daytime vitamin are game changers. And silly me - I even treat this as a little before bed treat because its delicious.",5
11996,11997,review,"I really like the sleep tracker on this device. The heartrate monitor is spot on compared to what the doctor detected on 3 separate differences. With the accelerometer and heartrate sensor, the sleep stage detection is fairly accurate especially when it comes to REM sleep tracking because your heart rate changes. I found i'm getting a lot less REM sleep than average. I'm getting around 5% and the average you need is 20-25%. I have been having problems with memory and the REM stage of sleep is when your brain is storing memories, so I've decided to see a sleep doctor instead of a neurologist. I've been getting to sleep at 5:30am at the earlier regardless of when i try to get to sleep. My memory is horrible, so if i can improve my REM sleep it could literally change my life. The alarm clock on the watch is useful as it plays a tone and vibrates and typically your arm is near your head when you sleep, so if you have roommates that don't want to hear your alarm going off, this is a good solution. It functions well and swiping the screen or turning the dial works instantly. There's even a flashlight app you can download. The sleep tracker alone is worth the price. I love how you have thousands of watch faces to choose from and I ordered a stainless steel band that installs easily for more formal occasions. One problem I did have is that the plastic band ripped almost off within the first 2 weeks. Luckily, they give you an extra band, so i'm using the spare, but i'm afraid it will rip too. I like the water mode where it ejects the water. I don't know if it's just a gimmick or if it actually works, but it's a pretty cool idea. The activity tracker is accurate and of course there's a step counter. It's easy to text (for texting on a watch) and no one can tell if you're talking to them on your watch or on your cell phone so that's pretty cool. The bixby doesn't work that well, but that's about my only complaint so if you have $320 bucks to spare (I got an ""open box"" one for $283 and it's like new) then this is the watch to buy. Don't fall for the Apple Watch trap and get tied into having to buy all Apple products. They've fallen off so much in the last 5-7 years especially in their phones so stick to Samsung. It works great with my Galaxy S10+. Overall, it's expensive, but a great watch that looks good with any outfit since you can download so many faces.",5

If you are looking for an affordable alternative, then this could be a potential candidate. It does more or less everything that your apple watch does (disclaimer: I have never owned an apple watch, but I am familiar with all it offers) - health tracking in terms of your daily steps, heart rate, blood pressure and sleep analysis. Oh, and the most important feature, it gives you the accurate time 24*7. :) I was bored with my fitbit alta that does not do anything fancy. Although I paid less money for this than my alta, it definitely looks fancier, has color display, and does more in terms of health monitoring. For 50 bucks, you cannot go wrong with this. It has the looks and feel of an apple watch. The only feedback I have is that the band looks a little towards the cheaper end. Because this uses pin on its bands like traditional watches, you do not have much of a choice for the bands unlike apple watches.",5

20817,20818,review,"When the apple watch first appeared on the shelves, I was very skeptical. I thought ""What could that do that my phone couldn't?"". And for the most part that is true, with the exception of using this for fitness purposes. But now that I've had it for a while, I can say that I use this so often. Not only is it convenient to answer texts, but I mainly use this so play music from Spotify, which you can download songs to if you have Spotify Premium. I find this much more practical since this watch can last 3 times longer than my phone can on any given day. I wake up at 6:00 am every morning and at 11:00pm, it is just hitting 50% battery. This thing is a trooper and this is an older model. It is also water resistant up to 50 meters I believe and has a feature to eject water from excess sweating, rain, etc. Initial setup took a bit longer than expected since the power up process took almost 5 minutes.

24428,24429,review,"Price: $29.99 Positives: +Build Quality +Soft Silicone Band +Magnetic Charging Cable +Battery Life (5% used in 3 days tested) +Menstrual cycle tracking +SpO2 sensor..? +Blood Pressure readings..? +Display quality +5ATM water resistance Negatives: -Display square shape -Display dim brightness -Firmware and software not extremely refined -Sensor accuracy might not be the best Review: I'm no stranger to affordable fitness bands- especially Chinese imports. I've been using the Xiaomi Mi Band line of trackers since the 2nd generation and they are now on Gen 5. I've also used a couple of Umidigi's products but this is my first fitness tracker from them and I'm glad to see how far they've come since their Z Pro phones in 2017. Umidigi has been a brand that has been persistently present in the Amazon and US market which is nice to see since most Chinese brands like Xiaomi or Vivo never officially make it to our shores, requiring you to buy from an online importer or import yourself which can take over a month. That being said, Umidigi has also historically been a brand that, while touting extremely impressive hardware specs for instance with their breakthrough budget phone contenders like the Z and Umi Plus- have always somewhat lacked a refined application of software to compliment it. That is still somewhat the case here with the Uwatch 2s, however Umidigi is a smaller company than most other Chinese brands- software development is expensive and time consuming and yet still, each product they release gets closer in comparison with larger companies quality like Xiaomi and Huawei- and the Uwatch 2s is a great example of that, and one of their best products to date. The design of the watch is overall, quite nice. Build quality is good, especially in the softness and shape of the band. The face glass is pleasantly smooth and rounded at the edges while the aluminum frame does feel slightly too light and cheap, but at this price it's a step above what I would expect- quite nice indeed. It also has a tiny mark at the 6 o'clock area that lines up with the barely visible circle area of the home button which makes it slightly easier to tell which way is up when putting it on. I'll be making comparisons to the similarly priced Xiaomi Mi Band 4 often here since it's the band I have the most experience with recently as the 5 just came out and as far as build quality they are extremely similar- except for the addition of the aluminum frame on the Uwatch 2s and I think the Uwatch actually has a noticeably nicer band- it's very soft and shaped precisely. As for the rest of the design, I'm not thrilled that the display is a square shape on a round body- it doesn't fit too well and is noticeable in dim light when it's on- however once again at this price it's hard to expect a round display. The charger is also very well designed and is an almost exact copy of the old Pebble watch magnetic charger I had back in 2015. As for battery life, it's very good! Over the 3 days of use before this review the watch dropped from 100% to 95%. Seems to be on par with the 14-20 day life you get with the Mi Band's- much better than Fitbit or most watches. Now here's where things get a little cloudy. The Uwatch 2s does not list either a SpO2 sensor or Blood Pressure readings as a feature either on their site or in the product description- in fact it's specifically left unchecked in their product comparison chart. In use the watch does appear to have both of these options, and the bottom of the watch also appears to have an additional sensor next to the left LED diode. Normally when there is only a heart rate sensor and no SpO2 or BP there's just 2 LED's aside a center HR sensor, not 4 like the Uwatch 2s has. The options also seem to put out believable data although I haven't as of yet been able to test sensor accuracy. This being said, Umidigi has been known to include or advertise features that are not actually present or use software trickery. For instance some of their older and budget phones touted a dual camera system, and the camera application mirrored this, when in actuality the second depth sensor was just a dummy and the depth 'effect' for portrait photos was just a gaussian blur. Whether this is done intentionally or as a result of cost cutting during software development with uniformity over all models regardless of actual hardware capability is hard to say. As far as the Uwatch 2s it would seem that it does in fact have functional sensors for these features, however I find it strange that mention of this is specifically left out of all information about the watch. Moving on, the watch has very similar fitness, sleep and heart rate tracking to the Mi Band 4 and it seems to work just about as well too. It has all the same extra features too like watch faces, remote picture button, music integration, notifications, weather etc and the fitness settings are not automatic, which is to be expected at this price. As for software- usually the biggest downfall of a Umidigi product- it's actually pretty good here. The watch firmware and UI is not as lively, featured, or refined as say an Apple watch or Samsung gear, but it's not meant to be- the Uwatch 2s interface works just fine and looks pretty good too. It does what it should and most pertinent data is right on the watch face or can be reached quickly which is an important thing when it comes to wrist technology. Eric Migicovsky, the creator of the Pebble watch put it best- a smart watch shouldn't be so featured that it becomes just as distracting as our phones, it should be a simple and functional way to stay connected and free from distractions at the same time. That brings us to the app software. It's not the best and I hope they continue to improve and develop it but it's better than I expected it to be. It shows the tracked data from watch fine and allows you to change faces and operate sensors and features remotely. I wish it had some more specific settings and would allow people like myself that are on a graveyard sleep schedule to adjust when the watch senses sleep and controls DND and other settings beyond the available 12am to 11:59pm. It isn't the best but it is functional and does what I need. So is the Uwatch worth a buy? Is it worth getting over other watches? Yes, and maybe. For $29.99 this is one of the best values right now in fitness bands or 'light' smart watches, especially if you prefer a watch shape over the rectangle bands. It's functionally very similar to the Xiaomi Mi Band's but also is capable of syncing with Apple Health, and if the sensors really are there, also has SpO2 and BP which is hard to come by in bands below $50. This watch is a much better value than more mainstream options like Fitbit, and has more features than the $30-50 Xiaomi. That being said if you really value more refined and reliable software one of those options may be a better choice, but for features alone there's not much else that can beat the Uwatch 2s. One last thing, there are many widely known mainstream brands here in the US, and some Chinese brands that not known to the typical US public but are very good and are completely separate from the waves of no name generic Chinese products that are everywhere here on Amazon. Do your research, I guarantee you will be pleasantly surprised at how much quality and value you get from main Chinese brands like Lenovo, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Realme, TCL, Meizu, Umidigi and others. They are almost completely unheard of here in the US but offer high quality products at a fraction of the price. There's a reason Huawei is #2, and Xiaomi, Oppo/Vivo are #4 and #5 in top phone companies worldwide, don't just dismiss them- they are potentially great comparison options to more mainstream US choices.",5

35555,35556,review,"I go back to using the Fenix 3. Great watch, a bit slow, but it had several upsides to its use, at least for me back then. I am an Android user. These watches, in my opinion, work best on an Android device, specifically a Samsung. I have used Samsung Galaxy watches as well. I want to also state that I am not the biggest fan of flipping the wrist to see things on the watch, but with the Venu it is a whole different experience, and the payoff is its reliability and battery life. I have never had an Apple watch. Good for those that find it awesome, but I believe it when they say that you have to charge it every night, and many times before actual night comes. I have the Venu set to 20% brightness and it is exceptionally bright and EASY to read indoors at that percentage. I don't have always on. I set it so that when I flip it toward me, it stays onscreen a bit longer than usual (I selected medium). I don't run so GPS is not a care for me. I get all my notifications and they come in quickly. The screen to the touch is very responsive. The buttons are also quick to activate any part I want to get to. I wore it to sleep and finally showed a 1% drain in battery about 7 hours after having fully charged it. This morning I used it for the first time weightlifting (I workout with only dumbbells and a bench at home). I do a 30 minute max workout that works for me. I set up the watch to prompt me at the 30 minute mark once done, or 300 calories burned, whichever comes first. The heartrate is very accurate and steady throughout (you WILL NOT get a steady heartrate with Samsung Galaxy watches). The battery on a Galaxy watch will drain significantly faster. Apple, I guess, is cute , but its biggest drawback will be battery. After my 30 minute workout, my battery is still at 100%. I took the watch off the charger at 5:52 a.m. and right now as I write this review, it is still at 100% and it is 7:11 a.m. I personally do not care to take a call on my watch. I do not care to speak into it to respond to a text. In the end, and this is for everyone, DO NOT take anyone's word nor review (including mines) on what decision you should make. YOU should decide what is best for you. Some (many actually) like the pretty screen (beautiful on the Venu) on a watch and are okay with charging their watch every night. Many wear a smartwatch for status and \",5
